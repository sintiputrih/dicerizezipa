But even though the acting pair are very reserved when it comes to their family, they post rare photos of <a href=#>their daughters, Lincoln and Delta</a>, every now and then.</p><p>The <a href=#>Veronica Mars</a> alum and the “Armchair Expert” podcast host experienced parenthood for the first time in 2013, welcoming their eldest daughter, Lincoln, that March. The couple — who wed later that year — expanded their family when Delta was born in December 2014.</p><p>From the first moment Kristen held her baby in her arms, she absolutely embraced her role as a mom. Speaking to <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a> in July 2015, the Good Place actress compared motherhood to your “first 7th grade crush that overwhelms every molecule in your body.”</p><p>“But it’s permanent,” she gushed, pointing out how the positives of being a parent outweigh the challenges that come along with raising children. “Other than the sleep deprivation in the beginning and trying to figure out how not to screw your kid up, the rewards are mountains larger than the battles.”</p><p>It’s obvious the <a href=#>Frozen</a> star gets so much enjoyment out of being a parent, but she doesn’t play around when it comes to teaching Lincoln and Delta important lessons. Because Kristen and Dax made it their goal is to raise kind and caring little ladies, they have “very strict rules” in their household.</p><p>“We [are teaching them] how we treat people with respect … especially our family members,” the dedicated mom told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in May 2016. “We are going to be with each other in the long haul, so it’s important to always be respectful and treat your sister the way you want to be treated.”</p><p>In order to instill these qualities in their daughters, the longtime lovebirds know they need to exemplify them themselves. That’s why the CHiPs actor said he and his wife always make up “in front” of their children if they ever get into an argument.</p><p>“You know, generally, kids see their parents get in a fight and then parents sort it out in a bedroom and then later they’re fine, so the kid never learns, how do you de-escalate? How do you apologize?” Dax told <a href=#>Us</a> in December 2018. “So we try, as often as possible, to do that. If we fought in front of them, we want to also make up in front of them.”</p><p dir=ltr>In a September 2021 appearance on&nbsp;<i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i>, Kristen shared a little more about Delta’s personality. She described her youngest daughter as “candy obsessed” which has caused her to hide sweet treats all over the house. Delta often leaves notes for the&nbsp;<i>Couples Retreat</i>&nbsp;star that vary in tone.</p><p dir=ltr>“Sometimes it’ll be an ‘I love you,’ but most times, it’s about what stuff is hers and what not to touch,” Kristen said before sharing a note from her daughter. “Don’t disturb, Delta is starving to death. Only Mom can come in,” it read.</p><p dir=ltr>The note stemmed from Delta requesting to go get ice cream late at night before both of her famous parents shot the idea down. Kristen went on to say that there are also a lot of notes in her fridge from her kids about what she can and cannot eat. “I’m raising very strong women,” she added. Both of Kristen’s kids also request for her to dress up as Elsa from&nbsp;<i>Frozen</i> regularly.</p><p><strong>For a look inside Kristen and Dax’s family photo album and to see rare pics of Lincoln and Delta, scroll through the gallery below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46kqaKrpJq7bq7EpaNmmZ6ZeqWt12aqoZ2glr%2Blv4yrmKudXZuurrXLsmSpoJ%2BpvLR5zp9knZmlnLW1sdGsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-i-delete-a-time-series-from-prometheus-v2-specifically-a-series-of-alert.html><span>←</span><span>How do I delete a time series from Prometheus v2, specifically a series of alerts</span></a>
