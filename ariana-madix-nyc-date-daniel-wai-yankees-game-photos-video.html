The<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Vanderpump Rules</a> star was spotted sitting with the hunk at a <strong>New York Yankees</strong> vs. <strong>Cleveland Guardians</strong> game on Tuesday as they both wore Yankees attire and got cozy. At one point during the game, they were shown on the Jumbotron and were laughing, in a video that was shared to a Vanderpump Rules fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> account.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>There were also videos and photos from other Bravo fan accounts that showed the new couple talking to people around them while sitting in their seats and even posing for a photo with one fellow game attendee. Daniel, himself, also took to his own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> story to share moments from the outing, including a photo that appeared to show his feet in sneakers next to Ariana’s feet in sneakers. The game ended with the Yankees beating the Guardians 4-2, which was sure to make the lovebirds happy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ariana and Daniel’s latest game outing comes just a couple of weeks after she was seen making out with Daniel <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>at Coachella</a>.

Tom <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was asked</a> how he felt about the Coachella photos of Ariana and Daniel just a few days after they attended Coachella, and he said he was “happy” for her. “Yes I love that,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. He also noted that he “really” wants her to move on from their past relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As Ariana romantically moves on with Tom’s blessing, Raquel has&nbsp; been working on herself by checking into a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mental health facility</a> for treatment. A rep for the reality star said she had planned on checking into the Arizona location before the Vanderpump Rules reunion was recorded at the end of March, but decided to wait until the filming was completed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e49sZpqqmZa7onnMmpuisF2jxqR5w5qrnmWUlruqsctmrpqhXa6ur7fEnqpmn5Gism68x6irqKtdq7alsc5o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-enzo-ferrari-how-did-he-die.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Enzo Ferrari: How Did He Die?</span></a>
