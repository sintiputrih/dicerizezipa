Brand new to the Flip range this year is a revamped outer screen, with a big 3.4-inch size and the ability to do even more than it could before. While you're still going to want to open the phone to do most of your business (or just scroll through Instagram), the new outer screen means you can stay on top of your notifications while keeping your phone folded and safe.</p><p>But as cool as all that is, accidents still happen, and even the <a href=#>best smartphones</a> can't withstand a drop onto concrete without at least some damage. While keeping your phone folded and using the outer screen can help to keep it safe from hazards, the outside can still be chipped, cracked, or even shattered. That's where cases come in. Here are the best Galaxy Z Flip 5 cases you can buy right now.</p>Show 5 more items <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><h2 id=h-YEdddzNbNY class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=YEdddzNbNY>Tech21 Evo Clear Case</h2><h3>Best clear Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Clear and slim</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Excellent 12 foot drop protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Biodegradable</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Expensive</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>No hinge protection</li></ul><p>"Sleek", "futuristic", and "gorgeous" are all words you can easily use to describe the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 — so why would you hide that behind a piece of opaque plastic? Tech21's Evo Clear case is a masterclass in slim clear cases, offering excellent protection without obscuring your phone's design. The Evo Clear is made from a material that's resistant to yellowing from UV light, has self-healing properties to recover from minor scratches, and has an impressive drop-protection of up to 12 feet. Raised edges around the camera lenses protect them from damage, and it's even made from 60% biodegradable material that breaks down in landfill conditions. While not perfect, that's a lot less waste than a regular case.</p><p>But oh boy, look at that price. It's an expensive piece of kit, and also doesn't have any hinge protection. Hinge protection would, admittedly, add extra bulk onto the case, but it is a glaring omission at this price. Still, it offers a lot, and is definitely one of the strongest clear cases around today for the Galaxy Z Flip 5.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/8/5/87686833fbc740218a9e75c76f6aa5377c2a70c4.jpeg alt="Tech21 Evo Clear Case for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Tech21 Evo Clear Case Best clear Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-Fg5roTTKaS class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=Fg5roTTKaS>UAG Plyo Case</h2><h3>Best rugged clear Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Adds protection to a clear case</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Still slim and lightweight</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Military-tested drop protection</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Very expensive</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Lacks hinge protection</li></ul><p>Want a clear case, but don't want to sacrifice protection for it? UAG's Plyo case is worth taking a moment to consider. It's an extremely expensive case, with prices starting at $70, but it offers a lot to make that price seem reasonable. Firstly, it's a dual layer case made from shock absorbent TPU and hard polycarbonate, which means it offers a great blend of protection against scratches and bumps, and UAG has further bolstered that with corner airbags and skid pads. Even with all that, it's still slim and lightweight, adding barely any additional thickness to your Galaxy Z Flip 5.</p><p>It's expensive, as we've already mentioned, but the other major weakness is a lack of hinge protection. No protection for the spine does mean less bulk added to your phone as a whole, but that lack of protection for a vulnerable and vital area could be a turn off for some people. If it doesn't bother you, though, this is an excellent Z Flip 5 case you shouldn't ignore.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/8/5/da15a10592f9264dfa2e2f79a3c47551368fea22.jpeg alt="UAG Plyo Case for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> UAG Plyo Case Best rugged clear Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-dl148rwjLp class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=dl148rwjLp>Official Samsung Ring Case</h2><h3>Best ring Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Official Samsung product</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Very useful ring</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Slim and lightweight</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Number of colorways to match your style</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Lacking in any real protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Expensive for what it is</li></ul><p>Samsung makes its own range of cases for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, and while there aren't a huge number of them on offer, they have some fun features you don't find in too many other places. The imaginatively titled Ring Case has, you guessed it, a ring on it. The ring sits around the hinge and can be used as a finger hold, whether the phone is open or folded.</p><p>The rest of the case is made out of silicone gel, which is slim and very lightweight, but doesn't really offer much protection —&nbsp;especially at this rather high price. There are a number of colors, though, which can match your chosen color of phone, if you wish. The case itself is also made of "eco-conscious material", so you can be sure you're not sacrificing the planet for your phone.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/8/5/3b114625b70f245bd5476b6079b15348f6ab1807.jpeg alt="Official Samsung Ring Case for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Official Samsung Ring Case Best ring Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-vLATtrSVV2 class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=vLATtrSVV2>Haotp PU Leather Wallet Case</h2><h3>Best wallet Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Wide range of colorways</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Nice feel and grip</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Additional wallet space</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Protection only decent</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>No hinge protection</li></ul><p>The humble wallet case is one of the most enduring phone case types, and it's easy to see why. They're elegant, look and feel great, and they offer decent protection too. As such, it's obvious why we've fallen for this PU leather case from Haotp. Sure, it's not real leather, but PU leather is durable and easy to clean while offering good grip and decent insulation from scratches and minor bumps and drops. The real party trick is the wallet slot around the back, though, where there's room for a number of credit cards, spare cash, or travel tickets to nest.</p><p>Unfortunately, there's no hinge protection, and the protection against damage isn't going to be all that great, despite the additional inner casing nestling your phone. But if you're looking for a case with a larger number of colors to pick from that won't look out of place anywhere from a boardroom to a fast food restaurant, this is the case to check out.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/7/25/dea3da4d174472ad8ca4f59189746fd4e707a405.jpeg alt="HAOTP Galaxy Z Flip 5 Case,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Luxury PU Leather Wallet Protective Phone Case Card Slots Pocket Purse Women Man Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 5G Green" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Haotp PU Leather Wallet Case Best wallet Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-oOd29JH7iP class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=oOd29JH7iP>Zagg Bridgetown Slim Case</h2><h3>Best slim Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Slim and stylish</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Strong drop protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Anti-microbial coating</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Hinge guard</li></ul><p>Slim cases don't get much better than Zagg's Bridgetown case. Slim, stylish, and extremely well protected, the Bridgetown case is a fantastic case to pick if you want something that's slim, but still makes a statement and guards against damage — offering 10 feet of drop protection. The Bridgetown case has been strengthened with graphene, a high-tech material that's strong but flexible, and helps to dissipate heat away from your phone too. There's an anti-microbial coating to reduce germs, and there's even a thin cover for your hinge.</p><p>Like many of the cases on this list, this is an expensive option, but a worthwhile case with a lot of positives in its favor. With a slim, minimalist style that doesn't skimp on protection, the Bridgetown case is a great choice.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/8/5/a6cac5ce08ddac704a0e5411261b58f313a7e490.jpeg alt="Zagg Bridgetown Slim Case for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Zagg Bridgetown Slim Case Best slim Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-5qaRCOXsC5 class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=5qaRCOXsC5>Caseology Nano Pop case</h2><h3>Best stylish Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Stylish case with real pop</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Great grip</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Good protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Excellent price</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>No hinge cover</li></ul><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 is a gorgeous device, but sometimes you want a little more pop than current smartphone style allows for. Enter: Caseology's Nano Pop. The Blueberry Navy colorway we've highlighted is the most stylish case we've come across yet, with a bold yellow accent offsetting the softer blue body of the rest of the case. It's a great looking case, and one of our favorites for looks alone. But there's also brawn to fit the beauty, and while not as strong as other cases on this list, the dual layer construction of TPU and polycarbonate will do an excellent job at keeping your phone safe from everyday harm.</p><p>The price is also great, and a lot lower than many cases on this list — but of course, that comes with some sacrifices. It's not as well protected as other cases (but still solid), and there's no hinge protection. But even with this in mind, it's a great Galaxy Z Flip 5 case, and there are quieter colors too, if you want something a little less loud.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/8/5/5ff064affff7dc55f8de5327ea234119aee83cca.jpeg alt="Caseology Nano Pop Silicone Case Compatible with Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Case (2023) - Blueberry Navy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Caseology Nano Pop case Best stylish Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-v7mnGCgyGX class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=v7mnGCgyGX>Torro Leather Case</h2><h3>Best leather Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Premium hardcrafted leather</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Good protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>great price</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>No hinge guard</li></ul><p>Leather phone cases are a staple and date all the way back to the very first cell phones. Torro is one of the best in the business where leather is concerned, and this case has been handcrafted in the U.K. from the finest top-grain premium U.S. leather that's been minimally treated, as to better preserve the natural appearance and softness of the material. It feels good, looks even better, and is 100% the finest leather case you can buy today. Protection is a little less than more specialized rugged cases, but the inner frame will still do a good job at deflecting harm from everyday hazards, though it's worth keeping in mind there's no hinge guard for additional protection. However, the price is great (when you consider this is premium leather), and the style speaks for itself.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/8/5/463ffcec4843afccd7e98b77c9ec189f87746ac6.jpeg alt="Torro Leather Case for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Torro Leather Case Best leather Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-bNIuoNGSU5 class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=bNIuoNGSU5>Spigen Tough Armor Pro Rugged Case</h2><h3>Best rugged Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Strong rugged protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Hinge and spine protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Kickstand included</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Expensive</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Adds bulk</li></ul><p>Big and bulky cases aren't hard to come by, but it takes real skill to create a truly rugged case — and Spigen definitely has that skill. The Tough Armor Pro is the most rugged case you can buy today for your Z Flip 5, and it's a great piece of kit. A combination of TPU and polycarbonate offers a great blend of soft and hard materials for protection against drops and scratches, and the drop protection has been further augmented with a layer of foam that adds even more resistance to sudden shocks and bumps.</p><p>There's protection for the hinge, and it also folds out into a kickstand, meaning the additional bulk added to the case doesn't sting too much. It's rather expensive as well, but given how much case you get for your money it's a worthwhile investment.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/8/5/f8f69eb0c1e442ff20bd43db5f1a3d7e359137a0.jpeg alt="Spigen Tough Armor Pro Designed for Galaxy Z Flip 5 Case (2023) - Black" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Spigen Tough Armor Pro Rugged Case Best rugged Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 case<h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVforyjtcueZpudo6l6tK3MrKynn12crq2t17Jks2WWobaxeZRmmpqrlah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-drugstore-concealers-6740819.html><span>←</span><span>The 6 Best Under-Eye Concealers of 2024, Tested By Us</span></a>
