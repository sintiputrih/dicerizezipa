Their 'Resident Wrapper' Tina understands that giving a gift goes far beyond what's on the inside, "giving and receiving a gift can spread smiles. The happiness felt by a receiver is like none other and when it is wrapped, it increases the excitement of opening it, thus adding to the happiness. Not only that, a beautifully presented gift shows the recipient that a lot of thought and effort was put into making sure the outside is as good as the inside."</p><p id=exa91boOot data-wc=102>For those of us not so lucky to shop in-store with a gift wrapper on call, Tina says that the secret to achieving a well-wrapped gift at home is to " use double-sided sticky tape, crease all of the edges of the box, fold any edges in so your paper has a neat finish, and used a good fabric bow. Don’t forget to cut the tails of the bow too." She also says that a top tip for those using luxury paper is to "practice with brown paper first. Once you’re confident, you won’t have to worry about wasting the good paper."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/49ded8f4ccf0-all-wrapped-up-at-the-berkeley-2.jpg><p id=eoYs3-yhcH data-wc=100>We all understand the importance of having the Christmas tree's undercarriage looking just as chic as the decorations on it. In a study by GWP, &nbsp;the UK uses 227,000 miles of wrapping paper each year, with the average household using four rolls of wrapping paper over the Christmas season. "If this statistic makes you cringe, remember that good quality luxury paper can be neatly folded and kept saved until next year," says <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Hello! Fashion</a>'s digital editor <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Natalie Salmon</a>, "I know plenty of thrifty fashionistas who save their paper to be reused for later occasions, to keep things stylish yet sustainable."</p><p id=eNvta08vvCC data-wc=85>Maybe you’re a fan of keeping things cohesive, opting for a theme of monochrome black and white with red ribbon, or perhaps you’re wanting to spice things up under the tree and add a pop of colour.
