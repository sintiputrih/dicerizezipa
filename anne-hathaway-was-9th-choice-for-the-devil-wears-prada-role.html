Hang in there; never give up.”</p><p>Hathaway starred as the assistant to ruthless fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly — played by <a href=#><strong>Meryl Streep</strong></a> — in the movie. <a href=#><strong>Emily Blunt</strong></a> (Emily), <a href=#><strong>Stanley Tucci</strong></a> (Nigel), <strong>Adrian Grenier</strong> (Nate) and <strong>Simon Baker</strong> (Christian) rounded out the A-list cast. Streep, 71, won a Golden Globe and received an Oscar nod for her role.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Rachel McAdams</strong></a> spoke out in 2007 about repeatedly passing on the part of Andy. “I’m not going to make movies just to make movies,” the Mean Girls star, 42, told <a href=#>Elle magazine</a> at the time of being the top choice for the role. “I have to be passionate about it. And at the same time, I can get very distracted when I’m working, and I like to get back to my life a lot.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Anne-Hathaway-Reveals-She-Was-the-Ninth-Choice-for-The-Devil-Wears-Prada-Lead.jpg><p><a href=#><strong>Claire Danes</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Juliette Lewis</strong></a> auditioned for the lead too, but Hathaway ultimately landed the job.</p><p>The Bride Wars actress told <a href=#>Variety</a> in June 2016 that she “had to be patient” while waiting for things to pan out. “I was putting on a shirt,” she recalled of learning that she got the part. “I had some buddies over. I remember running out in my living room, half-dressed, screaming — I got The Devil Wears Prada! I got The Devil Wears Prada!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hathaway shared another revelation about her career in January, noting that the world has been calling her by the wrong name for years. “<a href=#>Call me Annie</a>, everybody. Everybody, call me Annie, please,” she said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, adding that she wants to be called “anything but Anne.”</p><p>The Ocean’s 8 star explained that she used her formal moniker for her Screen Actors Guild card after she appeared in a commercial at age 14. However, only her mother calls her Anne “when she’s really mad,” leading to hilarious results when she hears the name. “So every time I step out in public and someone calls my name, I think they’re going to yell at me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinppVitaLAx5qumrFdrK60eZitn2abmKS2pLGMn6arZaSdsm6wxK%2BgpWWnmq6zv4ypqZqckWK%2FsLjEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rent-movies-at-youtube-html.html><span>←</span><span>YouTube to Rent You Movies</span></a>
