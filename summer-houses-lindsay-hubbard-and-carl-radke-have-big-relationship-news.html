She's a tough one to catch off guard!"</p><p>Per the report, Radke popped the question to Hubbard with a dazzling, custom-made 3.5-carat diamond ring&nbsp;by Nicole Rose, a New York-based jeweler who's a good friend of Hubbard. "This is the most incredible thing I have ever laid eyes on, except Carl," gushed Hubbard. "I don't think I slept at all last night, I think I just stared at this ring. It's gorgeous. He really crushed it, it could not have been more perfect."&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, they celebrated the romantic occasion with their family and friends at the restaurant Dockers Waterside, one of their favorite places. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>an Instagram video</a> posted by Queens of Bravo, several of their "Summer House"&nbsp;castmates attended the engagement party, including&nbsp;Andrea Denver, who <a href=#>announced his departure</a>&nbsp;from the show&nbsp;last June ahead of Season 7. Per <a href=#>People</a>, fans will be getting a glimpse of Hubbard and Radke's engagement in&nbsp;the upcoming season of "Summer House," which is expected to premiere on Bravo in early 2023.&nbsp;Congratulations and best wishes to these lovebirds!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnBkZoV3e9KupKadomK1sMHSnqpmpJmjsbSt2GafrpqSlr%2BlecCnm2abkae5br7AnaKeZZiWw6Z5waKeZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGK7psPSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peyton-shaw.html><span>←</span><span>Peyton Shaw Waverly NY Accident: A Waverly Teen Died in Newfield Crash</span></a>
