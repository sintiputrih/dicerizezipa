Their paths crossed a few more times in the tanned teen bubble that is the MTV VJ-verse and they began dating in 1998.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think we deserve a huge round of applause," the I Know What You Did Last Summer alum told the magazine. "I think we've done a really good job — it's been almost a year now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> What is more evocative of the year 1998 than this image? Daly and Love Hewitt are a late '90s time capsule from head to toe — from his tiny earring to the hem of her ruffled chiffon midi dress.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Granitz Archive 1/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> We're more impressed by how Daly and Love Hewitt conducted themselves in the aftermath of their relationship than during it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2003, Love Hewitt roasted her ex during MTV Bash: Carson Daly. After lampooning the former TRL host for everything from his taste in women (some not-so-subtle jabs were made at Daly's ex Tara Reid, in particular) to the, uh, volume of women he's spent time with, the Ghost Whisperer star ended her monologue on a sincere note: "Having you in my life was very important to me and being your girlfriend was truly one of the best things I've ever had the honor to do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similarly, Daly bragged about dating Love Hewitt while riffing with Ryan Seacrest in 2006.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I forgot you dated her," Seacrest told his New Year's Eve special rival. "She has the clearest skin."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> While it's unclear exactly what happened between the pair, Daly had some qualms about the how of it all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Daly reportedly told People that he learned about his breakup not from Love Hewitt but from Howard Stern.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I woke up to Howard Stern telling me my relationship with [Jennifer] was over," he said. "Then I heard Steve Kmetko on E! say, 'Just off the Associated Press: Jennifer Love Hewitt and Carson Daly have officially broken up."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Daly maintained that he told his ex how he felt about the only-in-Hollywood scenario.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If we were going to break up officially like this, maybe we could have just talked about it," he remembered telling her. "I don't see why you had to tell your publicist. And now I have been publicly humiliated."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Public humiliation notwithstanding, the exes hashed things out during an adorably awkward episode of Daly's talk show, Last Call with Carson Daly, in 2005.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Daly opened up about getting a tattoo of the actress's name on his leg and then having it covered up (allegedly at Reid's behest) with a crab claw pocket knife (yes, it's what it sounds like).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later, the host told his guest, "I blame the breakup on you, you blame it on me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For the time being, no matter what happened, I was a really good girlfriend to you and you were a great boyfriend," Love Hewitt told Daly. "We had a lot of fun and it was a good time in our lives and we should end it like that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It really was," Daly conceded, adding, "It ended a little weird, I gotta be honest."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It did," Love Hewitt admitted, "but that doesn't matter."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Agree to disagree?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, it's clearly water under the bridge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Daly congratulated his ex after learning that she was expecting her first child with then-fiancé Brian Hallisay in 2013. "I wish her healthy motherhood," he told Us Weekly.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, Love Hewitt celebrated the MTV Video Music Awards with a fitting <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>throwback of her and Daly</a> on the red carpet 20 years prior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Daly is now a father of four: Jackson, Etta, London, and Goldie. He wed longtime girlfriend Siri Pinter in late 2015.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The TV personality has been hosting NBC's The Voice since 2011.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Love Hewitt wed Hallisay in late 2013 — five days before she gave birth to their first child: Autumn. The Client List alum and her former co-star have since welcomed two more children together: Atticus and Aidan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress currently stars in fan-favorite Fox drama 9-1-1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Obq2ailaO7qrLEq2Slp6aaeqmx1qKrrWWTlr%2B0u81mm5qkqWK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniella-monet-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Daniella Monet Net Worth</span></a>
