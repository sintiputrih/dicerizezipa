He is probably best known for his role as Dr. Mark “McSteamy” Sloan in the TV series “Grey’s Anatomy”, but also for starring in films like “Valentine’s Day” and “Burlesque”.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Eric Dane is? According to sources it has been estimated that Eric Dane’s overall net worth is $7 million. Dane earned his wealth by appearing in numerous television roles throughout the 2000s and later, but also for acting in some well known films. Since he is still an active member of the entertainment industry, his net worth continues to grow.</p><h3>Eric Dane Net Worth $7 Million</h3><p>Eric was raised in San Francisco by his Jewish mother, but attended Sequoia High School in Redwood City, California and then transferred to San Mateo High School California, graduating in 1991. During his high school years, Eric was an athlete and played in the water polo team, but after appeared in the school play of <a href=#>Arthur Miller’s</a> “All My Sons”, which was when he apparently decided to start an acting career. Two years after graduation, Dane moved to Los Angeles and began by playing small roles in TV series such as “The Wonder Years”, “Saved by the Bell” and “Married…with Children”. However, his more intense acting career started in 2001, when he was cast in a recurring role in American medical drama series “Gideon’s Crossing”. Two years later, Eric got his second recurring role, that of Jason Dean in the well-known TV series “Charmed”, in which he appeared for two seasons. These laid the basis of his net worth.</p><p>When it comes to his television film career, his first notable role was in “The Basket” (1999) and his later appearances include two biographical films – “Serving in Silence” (1995) and “Helter Skelter” (2004). Apart from these, he appeared in other sitcoms and films such as “Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane”, “Sol Goode”, “Feast” and “X-men: The Last Stand”. In 2005, Eric guest-starred in the second season of the medical drama series “Grey’s Anatomy”, but positive audience reaction to his character resulted in Dane becoming the show’s third season regular. In 2006, he portrayed the brother of a gay man in the A&E television film “Wedding Wars”, and in 2010, alongside <a href=#>Patrick Dempsey</a>, he appeared in the romantic comedy “Valentine’s Day”. Eric joined the main cast of TNT apocalyptic drama series “The Last Ship” in October 2012, and has been starring as Tom Chandler, ever since. All have added to his net worth.</p><p>When it comes to Eric Dane’s private life, he married actress <a href=#>Rebecca Gayheart</a> in October 2004 and the couple has two daughters. However, Dane was involved in a scandal when he appeared in a nude tape with <a href=#>Kari Ann Peniche</a> and his wife, making the headlines. In June 2011 he checked himself into rehab and entered the treatment center to deal with his prescription drugs dependency problem. Eric supports the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, a non-profit organization which provides support to families that have lost a member in the armed forces.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.105527638191><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Eric Dane</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$7 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 9, 1972</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Francisco, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Sequoia High School, San Mateo High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Rebecca Gayheart (m. 2004)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Billie Beatrice Dane, Georgia Dane</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Leah Dane</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Eric William Dane , Dr. McSteamy</td></tr><tr readability=0.28070175438596><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/Eric-Dane-273319782872658</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/realericdane</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.39130434782609><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/realericdane</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199312</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, Satellite Award for Best Television Ensemble</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>People's Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Actor</td></tr><tr readability=18><td>Movies</td><td>Burlesque, Valentine's Day, Marley & Me, Wedding Wars, Open Water 2: Adrift, X-Men: The Last Stand, Painkiller Jane, Feast, Helter Skelter, Sol Goode, The Basket, Seduced by Madness, Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story, Grey Lady, Ball & Chain</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>TV Shows</td><td>Project Greenlight, Charmed, The American Embassy, Gideon's Crossing, Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane, Married... with Children, Grey's Anatomy, The Last Ship, Crisis Center</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=38><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>Television is a lot of fun.
