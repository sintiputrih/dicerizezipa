Although we have had protesters before, as well as fundamentalists at the show this group of protesters are hate criminals and preach using lude and violent language and imagery that I wish I protect you all from. Their message is of hatred and divisiveness, but inside at the Monsterball we preach love and unity. My request to all little monsters and public authority is to pay these hate criminals no mind. Do not interact with them, or try to fight. Do not respond to any of their provocation. Don’t waste your words, or feelings, no matter what you hear or see. You are more fortunate and blessed than they are, and in your heart just pray for them. Although I respect and do not judge anyone for their personal views on any politics or religion, this group in particular to me, is violent and dangerous. I wanted to make my fans aware of my views on how to approach, or rather not approach, these kinds of hate activists. Be inspired to ignore their ignorant message, and feel gratitude in your heart that you are not burdened or addicted to hate, as they are.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-3d90c4ad86158eb6c83afd165578e7d4-8-0-0@published data-word-count=46>Well-played. You think she’s taking the high road? No, she’s winning, because Gaga of all people knows the best way to piss off an attention-seeker is to deny them the reaction that they’re after. But, really, it’s a sweet message. Today we are all Team Gaga.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-3d90c4ad86158eb6c83afd165578e7d4-9-0-0@published data-word-count=15><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> [Twitter]<br><a href=#>Lady Gaga responds to Westboro Baptist Church, remains classy while doing so</a> [ONTD]</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Lady Gaga Versus the Westboro Baptist Church</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloaWdgbHytrcOylqCZl5ast7HRrKysl6SdsqDDxKyrm6eipHupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-ford-silver-wikipedia-age-wife-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jordan Ford Silver Wikipedia Age: Wife And Net Worth</span></a>
