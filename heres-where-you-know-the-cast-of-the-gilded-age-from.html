Fans may recognize McDonald from her role on "The Good Fight," opposite fellow "Gilded Age" star Christine Baranski. She told Newsweek, "Oh my God, I love her so much."</p><p dir=ltr>McDonald is mostly known for her roles on stage, having won six Tony Awards, <a href=#>a record</a>.&nbsp;She played Billie Holliday in "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill," one of her Tony wins, which HBO televised. She talked to <a href=#>WhatsOnStage</a>&nbsp;about the weight of playing such an iconic figure. "I feel that there's a huge responsibility in playing her, because you don't want to make a caricature, you want to try and relay the truth about her, the truth about her essence, as much as you possibly can."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG1mbYFye8eeqZ6rXay1pr7EZrCorV2gu7DDjK2fnmWTlsC1ec6fZK2glWK0qrjDnptmmZeaeqe%2BzqZm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taposiris-magna-mummies.html><span>←</span><span>Experts Baffled By Discovery Of Mummy with Gold Tongue</span></a>
