In the photo, James, 58, sports a flannel button-down while shrugging his shoulders with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>Social media users have playfully captioned the picture with comments like “<a href=# rel=noopener>that one onion ring</a> in your bag of fries,” and “I’ll <a href=# rel=noopener>take a shot</a> if you take a shot.”</p><p>Fans of The King of Queens may recognize the promotional image from the CBS sitcom that aired from 1998 to 2007. James played Doug Heffernan, a delivery driver who lives in Queens, New York, and is married to Remini’s character, Carrie.</p><p>Last week, the sitcom celebrated its 25th anniversary. Remini <a href=# rel=noopener>took to X</a> to commemorate the milestone on Thursday, September 21.</p><p>“As soon as production started on season one, I knew I was home, and I am blessed to say I was part of a truly special show that went on for nine seasons and 207 episodes and still lives on successfully in syndication,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Leah-Remini-Reacts-to-Viral-King-of-Queens-Meme-I-Absolutely-Love-Them-2.jpg><p>She continued: “I want to let you all know that I see the comments where you say that you fall asleep every night to The King of Queens, that it got you through a rough day and tough times in your lives, that you laughed for the first time in your day watching us, or that you watch several episodes a day, or that you and your family bond over watching the episodes in syndication.”</p><p>James and Remini went on to costar in the CBS sitcom Kevin Can Wait, which premiered in September 2016. The <a href=#>show was canceled</a> after two seasons.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In 2015, Remini shared her first impression of auditioning during a TV special looking back at the comedy series.</p><p>“He made me laugh in the first two seconds of meeting him,” she said. “It was just instant chemistry. Really, Kevin was the reason I did [the show]. Kevin was very disarming when I walked in the room. Kevin smiles with his eyes, and there’s something so sweet and warm about somebody like [that]… Their soul comes out. He was one of those people to me. So, I fell in love with him, and he was my ‘husband’ for 10 years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOemZhiv6a5yKegZqqVlrC1v4ytpmaumaeurXnToZxmo5mjtG67xWaorp2Vo8BuucSmnKxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-aniston-on-childhood-trauma-dies-critical-mom-dyslexia-2015211.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Aniston on &amp;quot;Childhood Trauma-dies&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Critical&amp;quot; Mom, Dyslexia</span></a>
