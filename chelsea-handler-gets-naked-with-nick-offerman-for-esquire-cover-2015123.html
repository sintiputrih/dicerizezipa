Both stand with their backs (and bums) to the camera, hands interlocked, toes overlapping, as they look nonchalantly over their shoulders, mimicking <strong>John Lennon</strong> and <strong>Yoko Ono</strong>'s nearly identical photo from their 1968 Two Virgins album.&nbsp;</p><p>The headline on the cover reads simply: "Women & Men: An Issue About Our Current Difficulties." According to the magazine's website, it will be "devoted entirely to how men and women interact."</p><p>Parks and Recreation fans are likely used to seeing Offerman, 44, in polo shirts and slacks, but the actor isn't one to shy away from nudity in other roles. He bared all for Deadwood in 2004, and he showed his butt in the 2012 comedy Somebody Up There Likes Me.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I love performing — and I'm not an exhibitionist, I'm not a Kardashian, by any stretch. And I'm not built in the way that people regularly ask me to bare myself," the actor (married to <strong>Megan Mullally</strong>) told <a href=#>Flavorwire</a> of stripping down on camera. "But when things call for it, I've done it on stage, I've done it on screen…I enjoy the beauty of nature."&nbsp;</p><p>Handler, 40, is similarly unfazed by nudity. Though she told <a href=#>Elle.com</a> she wouldn't show her vagina, she argued that nipples were fair game for social media. "You obviously can't publish underage girls' photos," she told the site, "but I'm in charge of what I want to do with my own body."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoJWhwKatjKGYp5ycmr9us8StqmamkaCypXnWoquhZZ6esKx5zp%2Bdnqqdlrtuss6rZJ6roaq2s7GMnKavnaJif3F9lGppbGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cameron-diaz.html><span>←</span><span>Cameron Diaz: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</span></a>
