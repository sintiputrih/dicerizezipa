Additionally, it’s the first time that the lead of the season has not appeared on the franchise in the past — and that may impact a lot.</p><p>“It was really funny. There were some times where we’d be walking a thousand miles an hour and talking and he would just stop and say, ‘Guys, I <a href=#>don’t know what you’re saying</a>. I’ve never done [this]. I don’t know what a rose ceremony is,” host <a href=#><strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a> told Us Weekly exclusively. “We had to really go back and learn our ABCs and spoon feed this guy. There was a sense of innocence naivete that was very endearing about that because he was also real: Everything was happening to him for the first time — group dates, two-on-ones, rose ceremonies. His eyes were just, like, wide-open, going, ‘Oh, this is crazy!'”</p><p>The entrepreneur, who was originally set to be part of<a href=#><strong> Clare Crawley</strong></a>‘s season of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, also feels honored that <a href=#>he’s able to be a role model</a> as the first Black Bachelor.</p><p>“On night one, he tells me he <a href=#>feels pressure being</a> the first Black Bachelor. He feels like, ‘I have to serve a community. I have to serve a family. I have to serve myself,'” the producer said. “There’s a lot of weight on his shoulders and he owns that and he really leans into it and I love it.”</p><p>The real estate broker <a href=#>has been open about</a> the type of women he’s hoping to meet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m looking for qualities that my mom embodies, and that’s selfless, honest, caring, compassionate and <a href=#>those are qualities</a> found in women all shapes, sizes and races and it’s not a Black or white thing,” he said on Good Morning America following the announcement of his casting. “I’m hoping when that limo pulls up there’s a lot of diversity and I see every type of woman coming out of that limo.”</p><p><strong>Why did Colton Underwood have to stay 100 yards away from Cassie Randolph?
