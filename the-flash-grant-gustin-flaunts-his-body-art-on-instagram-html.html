Likewise, some of the stars of the show find creative ways to express themselves in the real world. One The Flash star, in particular, <a href=#>Grant Gustin</a>, uses body art as one way to set himself apart. Here are a few of the actor’s Instagram snaps of his tattoos, plus what he says about them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Grant-Gustin-at-Comic-Con.jpg><h2><strong>Grant Gustin’s tattoos reflect his experiences</strong></h2><p id=par-2_65>“I’ve got a Virginia tattoo right here. It’s where I’m from,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Gustin told Young Hollywood</a> in an interview during Comic-Con. The star was referring to a tattoo positioned on his left upper torso, as seen in several <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Instagram photos</a>. But, it appears that Gustin’s home state is not the only subject close to his heart. He has inked other symbols that mirror his personal life.</p><h2><strong>Gustin’s love and passion</strong></h2><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_81>Gustin tied the knot with <a href=#>LA Thoma Gustin</a> in December of 2018, but the couple went a step further than traditional wedding rings to symbolize their union. The twosome doubled down with coordinating tattoos, which Gustin <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>shared an image</a> of on Instagram. Gustin sports the letters “LA” on his arm, while his wife’s arm is adorned with a “G.” As a finishing touch, the initials are pierced with a tattooed arrow that begins on one arm and ends on the other.</p><p id=par-4_57>In the same Instagram post, the actor shared more body art featuring a symbol for The Flash character and the text “Love [above] all else.” In the image caption, Gustin wrote: “LA and I got the coolest tattoos from the legend, [Mr. K]. He also added this little [The Flash symbol]. I can’t wait for our next session! Gonna be insane…”</p><h2><strong>Superhero fan art</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_23>&nbsp;“Superman…I love him,” reads the inscription in his mother’s handwriting on Gustin’s left forearm. In a video from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>DC All Access</a>, Gustin explained:</p><p>When I was a kid, I was a huge Superman fan. And also really into drawing and coloring. And I was like four or five, and so my mom used to draw him for me, Superman, and I would color that in. So that’s why it’s her handwriting. And this was also a line in my first professional job.</p>Grant Gustin on DC All Access<h2><strong>Honoring man’s best friend</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-6_48>Gustin is not shy about sharing his adoration for his pets on social media. His collection of cute dog pictures is enough to give any animal lover a case of the warm and fuzzies. Now, the entertainer has a portrait of his beloved pooch, Jett, on his arm.</p><p id=par-7_57>He <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>shared a snapshot</a> of the tattoo and added a caption that read, “This one is special. I have been wanting a portrait of my best bud, Jett, for a long while now. We’ve been through a lot together, and now he can be with me always. Thank you for this perfect piece,&nbsp;Doctor Woo. You’re a legend.”</p><h2><strong>Grant Gustin</strong>, b<strong>ody art aficionado</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-8_43>Aside from the tattoos celebrating his love and family, Gustin sports other marks, including a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">skull on his forearm</a> and the word, “gold” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">on his shoulder blade</a>.
