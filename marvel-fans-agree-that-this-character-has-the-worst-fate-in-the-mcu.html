Something the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU</a></strong> has always done is depict its superpowered protagonists as fallible individuals who sometimes make grave mistakes, causing others to lose their lives in the process. But which character has the very worst fate in the whole franchise? Fans have agreed that there is only one option.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>As first pitched by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">u/josephexboxica</a> on the r/MarvelStudios subreddit, many think that Hope Shlottman from Jessica Jones season 1 has the most horrific fate of anyone in the entire MCU. For those who don’t remember, Hope is a victim of Kilgrave’s, who uses his mind-control powers to not only kidnap and rape her for months, but also make her murder her parents. She then had to kill herself in order to avoid becoming the Purple Man’s puppet once more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>OPINION: Nobody in the entire MCU suffered a worse fate than Hope Schlottman in Jessica Jones S1</a><br>by<a href=#>u/josephexboxica</a> in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>When put like that, it’s hard not to agree that Hope ⏤ ironically, given her name ⏤ is the most hopeless case in the entire MCU.
