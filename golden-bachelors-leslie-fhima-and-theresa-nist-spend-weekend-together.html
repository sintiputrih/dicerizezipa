Daphne and her son Yossi were present as well.</p><p>Golden Bachelor fans flooded Theresa’s comments with support, lauding the pair for staying close after Gerry, 72, chose Theresa.

In a joint interview, Gerry said, “Theresa and I have had a number of heart-to-heart conversations and we’ve looked closely at our situation — our living situation — and we’ve kind of come to the conclusion mutually that it’s time for us to dissolve our marriage.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A few days later, Theresa thanked fans for their support in a <a href=# rel=noopener>post via Instagram</a>.</p><p>“It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life, something I never expected to happen at this point in my life and I truly thought it was going to last forever,” she wrote of the relationship.</p><p>“It turns out, even at the age of 70, you don’t know everything,” she continued. “Sometimes things don’t go the way you planned and that’s okay. I take so many positives away from this experience, most importantly and above all the incredible friends I now have in all of these amazing, wonderful women and in Angie and Jenny, Payton and Charlee, the producers, the production crew and so many of you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagp5yZsq95wZqaoZ2cpL%2B0ecueqqWhlWKzqbXMmmSappRiwamx0Z6qmmWensC1edKpnKecXayyprfEp5tmrJ%2BcsrW0xKtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./destiny-2-legendary-shards-guide.html><span>←</span><span>Destiny 2 Legendary Shards: What They Are and How to Get Them</span></a>
