However, they not only have many cells, but specialized cells that carry out different functions. Groups of cells form tissues and organs, which perform different functions for the survival of the organism.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-an-organelle></span>What is an organelle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Organelles are <b>specialized structures that perform various jobs inside cells</b>. … The term literally means “little organs.” In the same way organs, such as the heart, liver, stomach, and kidneys, serve specific functions to keep an organism alive, organelles serve specific functions to keep a cell alive.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-colonial-form></span>What is colonial form?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In biology, a colony is <b>composed of two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another</b>. … Unitary organisms have determinate development (set life stages) from zygote to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals (colonies) are visually distinct.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-meant-by-prokaryotic></span>What is meant by prokaryotic?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>prokaryote, also spelled procaryote, <b>any organism that lacks a distinct nucleus and other organelles due to the absence of internal membranes</b>.

Differences in cellular structure of prokaryotes and eukaryotes include the presence of mitochondria and chloroplasts, the cell wall, and the structure of chromosomal DNA. You just studied 2 terms!<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-classify-a-prokaryotic-cell></span>How do you classify a prokaryotic cell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms of the <b>domains Bacteria and Archaea</b>. All prokaryotes have plasma membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, a cell wall, DNA, and lack membrane-bound organelles. Many also have polysaccharide capsules. Prokaryotic cells range in diameter from 0.1–5.0 µm.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-similarities-and-differences-between-prokaryotes-and-eukaryotes></span>What are the similarities and differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes – major differences<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th style=padding-left:0>Characteristics</th><th>Eukaryotic cells</th><th>Prokaryotic cells</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Cell size</td><td>Large (10-200 μm)</td><td>Small (less than 1-5 μm)</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Organism type</td><td>Both uni- and multi-cellular</td><td>Only unicellular</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Nucleus</td><td>Present (membrane-bound)</td><td>Absent (only nucleoid region)</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>DNA</td><td>Linear DNA bound to proteins</td><td>Circular, naked DNA</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-2-similarities-between-prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells></span>What are 2 similarities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Similarities: 1) <b>Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have ribosomes</b>. 2) Prokaryotic cells always have a cell wall and SOME eukaryotic cells (plants and fungi) have cell walls.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-similarities-and-differences-between-prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells></span>What is the similarities and differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th style=padding-left:0>Prokaryotic Cell</th><th>Eukaryotic cell</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Nucleus is absent</td><td>Nucleus is present</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Membrane-bound nucleus absent.</td><td>Membrane-bound Nucleus is present.</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>One chromosome is present, but not true chromosome plastids</td><td>More than one number of chromosomes is present.</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Unicellular</td><td>Multicellular</td></tr></tbody></table>Oct 12, 2019<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-structure-performs-similar-function-in-both-prokaryote-and-eukaryote></span>What structure performs similar function in both prokaryote and eukaryote?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have structures in common.
