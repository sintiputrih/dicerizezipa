The cast of the next fifth season of the reality series The Circle has been revealed in the first trailer, which will air at the end of this month.</p><p>For those of you who are unaware, let us inform you that The Circle is based on the original British TV series of the same name. The Circle debuted on the world-renowned streaming service Netflix in the year 2020. According to the show’s description, it is a social media game where “anyone can be anyone in The Circle.”</p><p>The Circle is not a dating show, but for some of the contestants this season, season 5 of the reality TV show might feel like one. As with the previous seasons, this season will also include a number of strangers living in various flats within the same structure.</p><p>Every week, all of the contestants on the television program The Circle can engage with one another via online conversations where they cast their votes for both the greatest and the worst competitors. With a brand-new cast of competitors, season 5 follows the same format as previous seasons. On December 28, 2022, Netflix will launch the fifth season of the television program.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-circle-building-1670587150883.jpg alt width=600 height=338 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Meet the cast of ‘The Circle’ season 5</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Brett Robinson</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Billie-Jean Blackett aka Bruno</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Brian Clark aka Brittney</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Chaz Alvarez</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Marvin Achi</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Oliver TwiXt</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Raven Sutton</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Sam</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Shubham Goel</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> Tasia aka Tamira</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> Tom Houghton</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> Xanthi Perdikomatis</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Meet_the_cast_of_The_Circle_season_5>Meet the cast of ‘The Circle’ season 5</span></h3><h3><span id=Brett_Robinson>Brett Robinson</span></h3><p>Many of you might be familiar with Brett Robinson from the acclaimed reality series Big Brother’s 20th season.
