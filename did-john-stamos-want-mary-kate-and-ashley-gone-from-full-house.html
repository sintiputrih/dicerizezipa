To comply with child labor laws, the Olsen twins were cast to alternate in the role of Michelle. They were jointly credited as "Mary Kate Ashley Olsen" in seasons two through seven. Full House producers did not want audiences to know that the Michelle character was played by twins. The sisters occasionally appeared together in fantasy sequences.</p><p>Full House was one of the few shows on TV where a baby character grew up in front of the cameras. Audiences loved witnessing the development stages of the character of Michelle. But some might not know that the actor, John Stamos, who portrayed the beloved Uncle Jesse was not the biggest fans of Mary-Kate and Ashley when the show first began. He even temporarily has them replaced...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-were-just-six-months-old-when-they-were-cast-in-39-full-house-39>Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen Were Just Six Months Old When They Were Cast In 'Full House'</h2><p>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's entertainment careers began when they were just six months old. The twins were cast on the first season of family sitcom Full House which began in 1987. The show ran until 1995 with the Olsen twins reaching eight-years-old. As the late 1990s rolled into the early 2000s they became teen idols with popular straight to video movies and Nickelodeon show Two Of A Kind.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Did The Olsen Twins Make While Starring On 'Full House'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> estimated their joint net worth at $100 million. In March 2012, both Mary-Kate and Ashley indicated their interest to retire as actresses in order to focus on their careers in fashion. They felt that their futures were in fashion, not in acting and discussed wanting to open a store as one of their future fashion-based endeavors.</p><h2 id=john-stamos-was-initially-annoyed-by-the-olsen-twins-and-got-them-fired-from-39-full-house-39>John Stamos Was Initially Annoyed By The Olsen Twins And Got Them Fired From 'Full House'</h2><p>The Olsen twins are now embedded into American pop culture. It's hard to imagine Full House without Michelle Tanner. But John Stamos, who portrayed the beloved Uncle Jesse, was initially not the biggest fans of the twins. Stamos admitted he got really impatient when it came to wrapping up a particular scene. At the time, the Olsen twins were not even one years old.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Full House': The 10 Best Michelle Tanner Episodes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was very difficult to get the shot,” Stamos told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Television Critics Association’s</a> semi-annual press tour in Beverly Hills. “So I [gesturing], ‘Get them out…!’ That is actually 100 percent accurate.” Stamos admitted that he influenced the decision to have the Olsen twins replaced. "They brought in a couple of unattractive redheaded kids. We tried that for a while and that didn’t work. [Producers] were like, all right, get the Olsen twins back. And that’s the story.”</p><p>Stamos and the Olsen twins ended up sharing a close bond. A sequel series, Fuller House, premiered on Netflix on February 26, 2016, and ran for five seasons, concluding on June 2, 2020. The twins are the only main cast members who didn’t return for the show’s reboot. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stamos tweeted</a> he was “heartbroken” the twins wouldn’t be joining the cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey-was-given-the-side-eye-when-she-asked-mary-kate-olsen-her-dress-size>Oprah Winfrey Was Given The Side Eye When She Asked Mary-Kate Olsen Her Dress Size</h2><p>Oprah Winfrey has been given the serious side-eye after her interview with twin actresses Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen resurfaced. Filmed in 2004, the chat show queen, now 68, asks the Full House stars had an eating disorder. "I know a new rumor [that's] recently surfaced has really upset you, right?" the billionaire probes.</p><p>The girls wait for the rest of the question before making a comment, after which Winfrey adds: "You know, the one about eating."</p><p>Ashley steps in immediately, replying: "Yeah, you know people are going to write what they're going to write. We try not to read the good or the bad because it just comes with the territory. Either you're too fat, too skinny and people are just gonna write what they..." Oprah then cuts in and pointedly asks: "What size are you, by the way?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashley appears particularly taken aback by the question and simply replies: "Size?" Mary-Kate chimes in at this point, explaining they have always been "petite." At which Oprah replies sarcastically: "Oh, that's so interesting!" This sets the audience off laughing, with the twins smiling along. Oprah adds: "That is so interesting, I'm obsessed with size, and you're like, 'I really don't know!'"</p><p>Oprah Winfrey has battled with her own weight over the years and is now a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Weight Watchers ambassador.</a> "If we were obsessed with our size it'd be, I don't know, a different story," Mary-Kate replied, trying to move off-topic.</p><p>Later that year, Mary-Kate sadly checked into rehab to seek treatment. It later transpired to be a battle with anorexia. After the clip went viral, many fans criticized Oprah for her interview tactics. Mary Kate and Ashley were also met with sympathy, as some questioned whether Hollywood chewed them up and spat them out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7ypuoysq5qln6h6uK3NrWSmmaKueqyt055kmqaUYq60tMuesGafn6OybrLRqKRmnqWhuW60zq6qnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./casper-jopling.html><span>←</span><span>Casper Jopling Bio, Career, Married, Age, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
