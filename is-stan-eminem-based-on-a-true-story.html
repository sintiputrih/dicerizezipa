He’s now the highest-selling rapper of all time, with over 60 million records sold in the U.S. alone, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. At the peak of his career, the Detroit native released “The Marshall Mathers LP,” which debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart. The album includes one of Eminem’s most acclaimed songs, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Stan,”</a> which tells the story of a man who is obsessed with the Grammy-winning rapper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Eminem raps from the perspective of a fan named Stan, who has written the rapper several letters. “I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan,” Eminem raps. Adding, “I got a room full of your posters and your pictures.” The music video for the song now has more than 129 million views and shows an even more gripping depiction of Stan’s story.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Stan has dyed his hair to match Eminem’s signature platinum blond buzz cut. The fan has plastered the walls of his basement with photos of Eminem and later develops a romantic obsession with Eminem. As rapped in the lyrics, Stan dies just days before Eminem is able to read his fan mail. Years later, “Stan” remains one of Eminem’s most beloved songs. But some fans may be wondering if the heart-wrenching track is based on a true story. Here’s everything we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">“Stan” isn't based on a true story.</h2><p>The final verse in “Stan” is written from Eminem’s perspective. He apologizes for not being able to respond to Stan’s letter sooner but also shares some concern for the seemingly disturbed fan. “You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling. To help your a-- from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some,” Eminem raps. “And what's this s--t about us meant to be together?”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The song is disturbing for many reasons, but the story isn't based on a true story.

From creepy phone calls to vandalized properties, obsessed fans have been known to cause chaos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In July 2020, <a href=#>A$AP Rocky</a> requested a temporary restraining order against a fan who was allegedly stalking him for two years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reports. Rocky claimed that a fan, named Micaela Jimenez, showed up at his Los Angeles home more than once and even vandalized his car.
