They’re going to believe Barkin.”</p><p>Grace also discussed Disney executive Tina Newman’s testimony that Heard’s Washington Post op-ed was the reason behind Depp’s loss of his role as Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of Caribbean” franchise.</p><p>“Blah blah blah,” Grace said. “I don’t believe her and here’s why: The op-ed came out, and very shortly after that, he was cut loose. Two and two still equal four.”</p><p>Still, she said, Thursday’s testimony was damaging to Depp’s case.</p><p>“All these witnesses talking about him spiraling, that he was so high, that he was so drunk, that he was so late,” she said. “Have you ever made a crew wait six hours? I haven’t. They don’t like it. Idon’t care how affable and likable he is, if he became unreliable, even in Hollywood, he was radioactive.”</p><p>“He is his own undoing, not Amber Heard.”</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.</strong></p><p>[Featured image: Fox News screenshot]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5%2B8qbrNsmSdnaCleqq%2FjKGgrGWfrLtuwc2dpqKml2K7sMCMmqSbnaJitaat0Z1knKqZorJuu82loKedXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-weaver-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Weaver Net Worth</span></a>
