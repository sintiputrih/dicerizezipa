The 24-track album is stacked with material and a <a href=# rel>number of high profile collaborators</a> show up. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Baby</a>, Young Dolph, Key Glock, <a href=# class=text-word rel>J.

It's already racking up tens of millions of streams with some of its biggest collaborations and singles.</p><p>But that isn't the only thing Gucci is celebrating this week. Alongside the release of the album he also got an official holiday named after him earlier this week. The city of Atlanta officially named October 17 as Gucci Mane day and shared the official proclamation to social media. In the comments fans reacted exactly how you'd expect them to, by cracking jokes. "Imagine saying 'Happy Gucci Mane Day'" one fans commented accompanied by laughing emojis. "They just be declaring any rapper’s days bro I swear," another laughs.

The video stuck out to so many people because Gucci is notorious for cosigning almost anyone. Thankfully, in the comments of the clip many stuck up for the rapper in the video and told him to continue grinding.</p><p>While Gucci hasn't been quite as prolific as usual recently he did drop two major compilations recently. Together they combine to an impressive amount of material, more than 100 songs. They were framed as the conclusion to his ongoing Icy Boyz series, which also includes his last studio album in 2021.
