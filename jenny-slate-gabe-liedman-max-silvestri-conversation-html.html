In many ways, it resembles Big Terrific, the weekly stand-up show Slate started six years ago with her good friends Gabe Liedman and Max Silvestri. (Silvestri still hosts it every Wednesday.) The event showcased the three hosts’ lovable and hilarious dynamic, and it is also where <a href=#>Slate met <i>Obvious Child </i>director Gillian Robespierre</a>. With <i>Obvious Child</i> opening wide this weekend, we asked Liedman (who co-stars in <i>Obvious Child</i> and writes for <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i>)&nbsp;and Silvestri (co-host of <a href=#>FYI’s upcoming food-centric&nbsp;<i>The Feed</i></a>, debuting July 12, and whose <a href=#>debut stand-up album, <i>King Piglet</i></a>, came out earlier this month) to interview Slate. The endeavor resulted in a very serious debate covering the most grave issues of the day. Just kidding! It resulted in a bunch of friends discussing what it’s like to watch a version of their own life, à la&nbsp;<i>Obvious Child</i>, butts, movies, butts, and movies. (We bolded the questions and comments that kick off certain areas of riffing.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ca3c922c24a683e041165624f5316adf-3-0-0@published data-word-count=30><b>Jenny Slate: Okay, so this is the conversation where we talk about what’s wrong with our butts?

I know mine is more confident than me in life, and I feel like Gabe’s character is also really together — not that Gabe’s not together in life, but it’s just a different type of together. Younger — they’re both younger than us.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ca3c922c24a683e041165624f5316adf-24-0-0@published data-word-count=43>GL: The feeling is like, “Oh, that’s what it looked like five years ago in my life.” You know?

Dean was like, “The characters aren’t you guys, but you are best friends and you do comedy,” and he was saying how weird it was to see Gabe and I, as Donna and Joey, sit between Jack Lacy and talk to him. He was like, “I think that guy’s kind of supposed to be me.” But not at all, actually. Gabe and I never really had that experience of like some young man picking me up in a bar, probably because we didn’t talk to anybody except for ourselves.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ca3c922c24a683e041165624f5316adf-27-0-0@published data-word-count=28>GL: Yeah, neither of us got hammered and stayed out late and hooked up with people at bars.

I just feel like every time I watch it, I’m putting together the puzzle pieces a little bit more, and I’ve almost completed the film. <i>Obvious Child</i> is a lot like <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>.

This is the one before they know what the ooze’s secret is. It’s still a secret.

That’s why you’re here.” But then she can’t remember anything about turtles.

They are?!” I did. I was so excited. I should look more closely at our press appointment sheet thingy that they give you. That’s also not what it’s called.
