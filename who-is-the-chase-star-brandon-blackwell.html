Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and James Holzhauer are only a few examples of trivia experts who have appeared in the revival since its first season and are by now pretty familiar to quiz show aficionados. <strong>Brandon Blackwell</strong>, however, is one of the newer chasers, who came into play only in its third season.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>While The Chase viewers were introduced to Blackwell in May 2022, when the season began airing, the curiosity surrounding this chaser remained. Now, with the second half of the season in full swing, not much has changed. If anything, the continued exposure to Blackwell doing what he does best has only increased public speculation.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-brandon-blackwell-and-what-do-we-know-about-him data-injectable=false>Who is Brandon Blackwell and what do we know about him?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Chase (@thechaseabc)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Despite being new to this particular quiz show, Blackwell has participated in a few others over the years. Born in 1982, he started the path as a game show contestant on Jeopardy! in 2008. That said, it wasn’t until 2012 with his appearance in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? that Blackwell became more well-known. After leaving the show with $43,100 in his pocket, he went on to appear in The Million Second Quiz, in 2013 where he earned second place (as well as $339,416), at 19 years old. In 2020, Blackwell returned to quiz life, by participating in the British show University Challenge.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately for the desperately curious, nothing is known about Blackwell’s personal life, as he tends to keep focus on his career. And with a career like this, who wouldn’t? Blackwell didn’t earn the nickname of Lightening Bolt for nothing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlpJ2ybq%2FHmqqeZaOprrN5wauYp5yfo3qjuMCcorCdnKF8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-van-reekum-age-wiki-biography-net-worth-height-in-feet-birthday-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Van Reekum Age, Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Height in Feet, Birthday, Husband</span></a>
