Battlepass (BP) weapons work well with most DPS units. Thanks to their CRIT rate stats, they’re especially good weapon candidates for balancing your characters’ CRIT ratios. But they do have a lot of competition.</p><p>There are plenty of other strong free weapons – oftentimes better than the BP weapons.</p><p>Because of this, it’s always recommended to look up a character’s best weapons before getting any of the BP ones.</p><p>But still, their versatility makes them really nice weapons to have.</p><p>And if you’re planning to get one, here’s a cheat sheet for their synergies with all the current playable characters.</p><table class="eqlfour basetbl center fullwidth nozebra bordercf headpad10"><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Great With</th><th>Decent With</th><th>Not Recommended</th></tr><tbody readability=25><tr readability=8><td>Serpent Spine</td><td>Itto, Beidou, Chongyun, Diluc, Eula, Noelle, Razor</td><td>Xinyan</td><td>Sayu</td></tr><tr readability=15><td>Viridescent Hunt</td><td>Fischl, Melt Ganyu, Tartaglia</td><td>Aloy, Amber, Sara, Yoimiya</td><td>Diona, Gorou, Venti, Yelan, Freeze Ganyu</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Deathmatch</td><td>Hu Tao, Raiden, Rosaria, Xiao</td><td>Xiangling, Zhongli</td><td>Shenhe, Thoma, Yunjin</td></tr><tr readability=17><td>Black Sword</td><td>Jean, Kaeya, Ayato, Keqing, Geo Traveler</td><td>Bennett, Ayaka, Anemo Traveler, Xingqiu</td><td>Albedo, Kazuha, Kuki, Qiqi, Electro Traveler</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Solar Pearl</td><td>Lisa, Ningguang, Heizou, Klee</td><td>Mona, Yae, Yanfei</td><td>Barbara, Kokomi, Sucrose</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><strong>Great</strong> means that it’s one of the character’s best 4-star weapon options.</li><li><strong>Decent</strong> means that it works on the character, but there are other much better 4-star options.</li><li><strong>Not Recommended</strong> means that there are significantly better options (usually 4-star or 3-star) or it simply doesn’t have synergy with the character.</li></ul><p>Additionally, here’s a closer look at each Battlepass weapon.</p><h3>Serpent Spine</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/08/50314/01-serpent-spine-genshin-impact-screenshot.jpg><p>Serpent Spine (SS) is an exceptionally powerful weapon.</p><p>Its passive has a stack mechanic that’s gained by spending 4s on-field. This has a maximum of 5 stacks.</p><p>At R1, each stack increases the damage you deal by 6% but also increases the damage you take by 3%. Plus, taking damage removes a stack.</p><p>Because of this strong passive, SS is easily one of the strongest claymores and weapons in-game – it can even outperform most 5-star claymores with higher refinements.</p><p>Among all the BP weapons, this is the one most worth getting.</p><p>It simply works well with every DPS claymore user, and it’s just significantly better than its fellow 4-star weapons.</p><h4>Serpent Spine Pre-Stacking</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/08/50314/02-pre-stacking-serpent-spine-stacks-in-spiral-abyss-genshin-impact-screenshot.jpg><p>A great technique for using Serpent Spine in Spiral Abyss is pre-stacking its passive.</p><p>This can be done by placing the character with SS in the first slot. Doing so effectively lets you get all 5 stacks before starting an Abyss chamber.</p><h4>Serpent Spine Stacks Cooldown</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/08/50314/03-serpent-spine-losing-stacks-on-burning-grass-genshin-impact-screenshot.jpg><p>There’s an internal cooldown between losing Serpent Spine stacks.</p><p>Only one stack can be lost every second. So even if your character takes multiple hits within a second, only one stack will be lost.</p><p>Similarly, if you take multiple hits for 2s, only a maximum of 2 stacks will be lost.</p><p>This is demonstrated by the photo above.</p><p>Diluc has sustained 3 instances of damage from burning grass. But because losing stacks has a cooldown, Diluc still has 4 SS stacks on him.</p><p>Basically, you lose stacks at a much slower rate than taking damage – which is great! You get to keep more stacks than initially stated.</p><h3>Viridescent Hunt</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/08/50314/04-viridescent-hunt-genshin-impact-screenshot.jpg><p>Viridescent Hunt is a good general bow.</p><p>At R1, its passive has a 50% chance of creating a Cyclone when the wielder hits an opponent with a normal or charged attack. This cyclone pulls opponents to its center and deals 40% of ATK as Physical damage every 0.5s. This lasts for 4s and can only occur once every 14s.</p><p>This cyclone functions as a situationally useful source of crowd control, especially against AOE. And for single-target, its damage is still a decent but small damage gain.</p><p>But there are already other great 4-star bows. Very often these are the better option for most bow users.</p><p>So it’s best to treat Viridescent Hunt as a general bow. It’s often not the best option, but it definitely works.</p><h4>Viridescent Hunt for Tartaglia / Childe</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/08/50314/05-tartaglia-riptide-with-viridescent-hunt-grouping-against-multiple-opponents-genshin-impact-screenshot.jpg><p>Tartaglia is currently the best unit that can take full advantage of this Viridescent’s passive.</p><p>His Riptide has a quadratic scaling. So his total DPS exponentially increases the more opponents he hits. This makes him an exceptional unit against AOE.</p><p>Viridescent’s grouping pulls opponents closer to him and lets him trigger Riptide against multiple opponents at once.</p><p>This is especially useful when you’re not using a grouper with Tartaglia.</p><h3>Deathmatch</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/08/50314/06-deathmatch-genshin-impact-screenshot.jpg><p>Deathmatch is a good polearm with notably high CRIT value and relatively lower Base ATK.</p><p>This makes it great for units that don’t heavily rely on ATK (like Hu Tao and Zhongli) but slightly worse for those that do – especially without any external ATK buffs.</p><p>But its passive does help give a bit more ATK. When there are 2 or more opponents nearby, the wielder gains 16% ATK and DEF. And when there are less than 2 opponents, their ATK is increased by 24%.</p><p>Still, there are plenty of other 4-star polearms that are just better choices for other units.</p><p>For instance, Deathmatch is great on Hu Tao, but Dragon’s Bane with higher refinements will be better.</p><p>So it’s best to look them up before going for Deathmatch.</p><p>Still, the gap between Deathmatch and the best 4-star weapon of other units often isn’t that big – so Deathmatch is definitely still a good option.</p><h3>Black Sword</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/08/50314/07-black-sword-genshin-impact-screenshot.jpg><p>Black Sword is a great but pretty niche weapon. Its passive increases the wielder’s normal and charged attacks by 20%. Plus it regenerates 60% ATK as HP when normal or charged attacks score a CRIT hit – this can be triggered once every 5s.</p><p>This passive is great, but there aren’t many characters that can take full advantage of it. The only notable ones are Ayato and Keqing.</p><p>Besides them, Black Sword is just considered a CRIT stat stick.</p><p>Because of this, it’s only recommended when you’re planning to use it for the characters mentioned. Otherwise, Amenoma Kageuchi and Favonius Sword are often enough for most sword users.</p><h3>Solar Pearl</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/08/50314/08-solar-pearl-genshin-impact-screenshot.jpg><p>Solar Pearl is a pretty flexible weapon – it works on all ATK-scaling DPS catalyst users.</p><p>When the wielder’s normal attack hits an opponent, it increases their skill and burst damage by 20% for 6s. And when their skill or burst hits, their normal attack damage is increased by 20% for 6s.</p><p>This passive is quite versatile, and most catalyst DPS units can benefit from it.</p><p>But, while Solar Pearl is a great weapon in its own right, it often loses value because of The Widsith.</p><p>This is a 4-star gacha weapon with a very strong passive, especially with refinements. It even competes with other 5-star catalysts at R5.</p><p>In most cases, Widsith just outperforms Solar Pearl – or they’re very interchangeable.</p><p>Because of this, there’s absolutely no need to get Solar Pearl if you already have Widsith. Otherwise, Solar Pearl is a viable and more consistent replacement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63Nnaamq6CkwW%2BvzqZmoJ2eqLWquoyipKmZk6l6or7EZpmarKShsrGt0qxksJ2Rpbyvv4ygpqicXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-surprise-cameos-in-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-including-one-from-kareem-abdul-jabbar-519403-html.html><span>←</span><span>All surprise cameos in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, including one from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</span></a>
