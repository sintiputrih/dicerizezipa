Boom! is an ode to Broadway musicals and the people who make them, featuring autobiography of <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Larson</strong></a>, the astonishingly talented writer/composer of Rent, who died just before the show’s opening night. Alexandra Shipp plays Susan, who was <a href=#>one of Jonathan Larson's girlfriends</a>.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Released on November 12, 2021, the movie portrays the story of a promising theater composer in his 30s, navigating love, friendship and the pressure to create something great before time runs out. It's also a tribute and a show of gratitude for the almost baton-like passing of support from the makers of musical theater, whom Larson views as a vanishing species. Adapted from the autobiography of Jonathan Larson and brought to the screen by<strong> Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong> and <strong>Steven Levenson</strong> , Tick, Tick.. Boom! presents a slightly more realistic yet sensationally cinematic depiction of La Vie Bohème.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Henderson Wade Girlfriend: Snowbound for Christmas Star Has 1 Daughter with Longtime GF Jessica Whatley!</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The cast of the movie includes <strong>Andrew Garfield </strong><span class="StyledComponents__CharacterNameWithAs-y9ygcu-4 gyGbpY" data-testid=cast-item-characters-with-as>as <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Larson</strong></a>, <strong>Alexandra Shipp </strong></span><span class="StyledComponents__CharacterNameWithAs-y9ygcu-4 gyGbpY" data-testid=cast-item-characters-with-as>as <strong>Susan</strong></span>,<strong> Robin de Jesus</strong> <span class="StyledComponents__CharacterNameWithAs-y9ygcu-4 gyGbpY" data-testid=cast-item-characters-with-as>as <strong>Michael</strong>,&nbsp;</span><strong>Vanessa Hudgens </strong><span class="StyledComponents__CharacterNameWithAs-y9ygcu-4 gyGbpY" data-testid=cast-item-characters-with-as>as <strong>Karessa</strong></span>, <strong>Joshua Henry</strong> <span class="StyledComponents__CharacterNameWithAs-y9ygcu-4 gyGbpY" data-testid=cast-item-characters-with-as>as <strong>Roger</strong>, and&nbsp;</span><strong>Jonathan Marc Sherman </strong><span class="StyledComponents__CharacterNameWithAs-y9ygcu-4 gyGbpY" data-testid=cast-item-characters-with-as>as <strong>Ira Weitzman</strong>.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><a href=#><strong>Get to Know</strong></a> your favorite celebrities and <a href=#><strong>Explore</strong></a> relationship details of <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> stars with <a href=#><strong>Celebs In-depth</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiYpZ2olrulvsBmqqGhoKV6qLXRpZ2roZWjsW6vzqagp59dpMK1ec%2Baqa2mlad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-photograph-movie-review-lakeith-stanfield-issa-rae-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Photograph Is an Imperfect Delight</span></a>
