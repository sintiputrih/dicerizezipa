The Massachusetts native wore a yellow and blue bikini with a straw hat.</p><p>The <a href=#>American Horror Story</a> alum<a href=#> debuted her budding belly</a> earlier this month when she went for a New York City stroll with her boyfriend, <strong>Sinisa Mackovic</strong>. The Boys Don’t Cry star wore a skintight dress while walking with and kissing the art gallery director, who she has been dating for over a year.</p><p>In 2016, Sevigny said that “not having had a baby yet” is the secret to her youthful skin. “I&nbsp;&nbsp;think the baby wear and tear and stress on your body is part of the reason why people say, ‘Why do you still look so young?’” she explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W</a> magazine at the time. “I really think that that unfortunately ages women, especially when they have children in their 30s, not in their 20s. So I think, first and foremost, it’s that and genetics.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pregnant-Chloe-Sevigny-Shows-Bare-Baby-Bump-in-Bikini-Pic.jpg><p>The Oscar nominee added, “And then I’m really into all the things they tell you to do, like moisturizing. I go to Dr. Colbert, who is this fancy dermatologist. I haven’t really gone the Botox route yet, but he does lasers and very expensive facials and stuff like that.”</p><p>Prior to her relationship with Mackovic, Sevigny was linked to <a href=#><strong>Luka Sabaat</strong></a>. “I remember seeing this beautiful boy and being totally struck,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cut</a> in February 2019 of the model, 22. “He smiled at me and I melted. I was like, ‘Who is this kid?’ To me, it’s not about his style. It’s more about his energy and his vibe. I feel like it’s the same with me: People are always like, ‘Oh, she’s a style icon.’ But it’s like, there’s gotta be something else, you know?”</p><p>The Golden Globe winner winner started acting in 1995 and is best known for her roles in independent films, including American Psycho, as well as HBO’s Big Love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aaoaSfmnq0sdWinqexXai1sMPSZpmamqlir7a5z2agp2WSnriqushmp6KbXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscars-stars-who-brought-family-members-2013252.html><span>←</span><span>Oscars: Stars Bringing Family Members Over the Years</span></a>
