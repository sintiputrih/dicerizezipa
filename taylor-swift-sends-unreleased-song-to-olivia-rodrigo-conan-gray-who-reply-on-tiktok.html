In the music video, Swift plays both girls: a shy girl next door and the supposedly mean cheerleader&nbsp;— it doesn't get more early 2000s teen drama than that.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-sent-new-version-of-you-belong-with-me-to-olivia-rodrigo-and-conan-gray>Taylor Swift Sent New Version Of ‘You Belong With Me’ To Olivia Rodrigo And Conan Gray</h2><p>Swift revealed she had sent the new version of the song to Olivia Rodrigo and Conan Gray ahead of release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You ok?
