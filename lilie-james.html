The circumstances surrounding her death are nothing short of chilling.</p><p>The distressing tale unfolded as Lilie’s father, frantic and worried when his daughter failed to return home, reached out to the authorities. It was then that the plot thickened, for the prime suspect in this heinous crime was none other than her ex-colleague, 24-year-old Paul Thijssen.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Australian Water Polo Coach Lilie James" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Australian-Water-Polo-Coach-Lilie-James.webp alt="Australian Water Polo Coach Lilie James" width=400 height=419 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Paul, who had previously served as a sports coach at the prestigious private school, reportedly made a nerve-wracking call to the police, a full four hours after it is believed Lilie met her tragic end. The exact nature of Paul Thijssen’s bone-chilling phone call remains shrouded in mystery, leaving all of us to wonder about the horrors that might have transpired during those fateful moments.</p><p>Sources from the school reported that a scary call was made to the police to report Lilie’s lifeless body. The authorities were searching for Paul Thijssen, and a crucial tip came from workers at a construction site in Vaucluse. They found a body in the water at the bottom of a cliff, which turned out to be Paul Thijssen himself.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Lilie James attended UTS University of Technology Sydney" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lilie-James-attended-UTS-University-of-Technology-Sydney.webp alt="Lilie James attended UTS University of Technology Sydney" width=400 height=465 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Lilie James Was Found Murdered</strong></h2><p>A shocking tragedy unfolded at a prestigious Sydney school, where a 21-year-old female water polo instructor, Lilie James, met a gruesome end, brutally attacked with a hammer. The authorities are currently on a relentless manhunt for her alleged assailant.</p><p>Lilie’s life was tragically cut short when her lifeless body, bearing harrowing head injuries, was discovered inside St Andrew’s Cathedral School in the heart of the city’s CBD, right around midnight on a fateful Thursday morning.</p><p>The grim discovery came to light after her father, gripped by worry and fear, reached out to the police when Lilie failed to return home. The prime suspect in this chilling case is none other than her former colleague, 24-year-old Paul Thijssen.</p><p>Paul, who had once served as a sports coach at the prestigious private school, hailed from the Netherlands but moved to Australia in 2015 and attended St Andrew’s for years 10-12. What adds to the intrigue is the surveillance footage that captured Thijssen accompanying Ms. James into a school gym bathroom at approximately 7 pm on a Wednesday evening.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lilie-James.webp><p>However, the shocking turn of events takes a darker twist as the footage shows Thijssen exiting the area well over an hour later, while Lilie James tragically never reemerges from that bathroom. It was around four hours later that Thijssen himself contacted the authorities.</p><p>Police were able to trace the chilling call to the ‘The Gap’ clifftop at Diamond Bay Reserve in Vaucluse, where they discovered a backpack and some of his belongings. Notably, Paul Thijssen had spent 18 months alone in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period that undoubtedly took a toll on many.</p><p>A source from the school reveals that while Thijssen may not have displayed signs of psychosis, this dark chapter in his life may have deeply affected him.</p><p>Adding another layer of complexity to this grim narrative, it has come to light that Lilie James and Paul Thijssen were in a ‘secret relationship’ for a few weeks leading up to her untimely demise. A close friend of Lilie’s disclosed that this ill-fated relationship had only recently come to an end, further shrouding this tragedy in mystery and sorrow.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Maine Shooting Victim Bill Young Wiki, Obituary, Age, Wife, Kids, Profession and More</a></p><p><img decoding=async title="Lilie James parents and brother" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lilie-James-parents-and-brother.webp alt="Lilie James parents and brother" width=400 height=474 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Lilie James Parents and Siblings</strong></h2><p>On October 30, 2001, Lilie James (age 21) was born to her father, Jamie James, and mother, Peta James, in New South Wales, Australia.
