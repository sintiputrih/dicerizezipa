While we wouldn’t necessarily expect his adolescent friends to catch up with the fact that something’s clearly bothering him, the character has spent the past season being completely ignored whenever he shows his vulnerable side.</p><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=885 data-injectable=true>This obliviousness, especially from Mike who’s supposed to be Will’s best friend, reached a mind-boggling new height in the penultimate episode of season four. After Will encourages Mike by explaining that he is the “heart” of their crusade against stranger things from the Upside Down, he breaks down crying, perhaps reminded of his own struggle. But much to everyone’s surprise, Mike doesn’t even realize his friend is helplessly sobbing two inches away from him.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Seriously, even Argyle who spent the entire season four high must have picked on something. If Mike not being in the picture at all annoys you too, perhaps this new viral meme on Twitter can at least give you a good chuckle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>i cannot do this rn<a href=#>#StrangerThings</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6OrhHaeh9Q</a></p>— habs (@vinyIgguk) <a href=#>July 2, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>Okay, that meme may be doing our boy Will a little dirty.
