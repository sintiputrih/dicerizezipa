The extreme filming schedule spanned a staggering 16 hours daily, kicking off at the crack of dawn at 8:00 a.m. and rolling on until lights out at 11:00 p.m.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, fellow executive producers Toni Ireland and Stephen Yemoh explained that they didn't necessarily film a game every single day.</p><p>"Each day was slightly different because we didn't shoot a game every single day, and then some days they have tests and things like that, so it just sort of depended on that," Toni disclosed. "They woke up around eight o'clock each day, exactly as you see on the show. The lights come on, the music plays, they get in line to brush their teeth, the guards came and delivered them their food."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Stephen further explained, "The earlier games would have a bigger cast, so they would spend much more time in the games arena and stuff like that. As we progressed through the series, we could get through games a bit quicker, but there were sometimes quite long days depending on what was happening. Nothing too crazy, there weren't like two days without sleep or anything like that."</p><p>"They weren't really sleep-deprived. They got a good night's sleep and they slept pretty well in the bunk beds," Toni added. Well, that's good to know, right?</p><p>Watch Squid Game: The Challenge on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecuopaBllJ6xbrXTZquao5ViwbB5xaKjpmWjpsKqsIygmKadXam1pnnCoZilpJWjtKY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-cooper-boyfriend-dating-history.html><span>←</span><span>Facts About Alex Coopers Boyfriend And Dating History</span></a>
