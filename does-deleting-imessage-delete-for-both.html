There is no way to unsend a text message or iMessage unless you cancel the message before it was sent. Tiger text is an app that allows you to unsend text messages at any time but both the sender and receiver must have the app installed.</p><p>Besides, Does deleting a message delete it for everyone?</p><p>If you want to remove a message just for yourself, you can still do that anytime by selecting “Remove for You”. When you choose this option, the message will be removed for you, but not for anybody else in the chat.</p><p>Beside above, How do you delete messages on iPhone so the other person can’t see it?</p><p>There is no way to remove texts from someone others phone without physical access to it, so keep that in mind when deleting a text for privacy purposes. If you’re using iMessage here, this will apply to iPod touch and iPad as well, but obviously SMS and MMS will only apply to iPhone users.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_delete_your_messages_from_someone_elses_iPhone></span><strong>Can you delete your messages from someone elses iPhone?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Your question is a bit confusing but, I think what you’re asking is if someone can delete messages from a phone remotely even if they don’t share an Apple ID. No, they cannot.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_retract_an_iMessage></span><strong>How do you retract an iMessage?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to GottaBeMobile, the key to unsending a message in iMessage is to take action before the text is delivered to the recipient. To kick things off, swipe down from the top-right corner of your screen to view your phone’s control center (pictured below).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_you_delete_a_message_on_iPhone_does_it_delete_for_the_other_person></span><strong>When you delete a message on iPhone does it delete for the other person?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>All replies. You cannot affect the message on the other phone. If you delete it on your phone it does not delete it from the recipients phone. You cannot retract a deleted message without restoring the entire phone backup and that is assuming that the message is contained in the backup.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_delete_a_text_on_iPhone_after_you_send_it></span><strong>Can you delete a text on iPhone after you send it?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no way to unsend an iMessage that’s been delivered to the recipient already, even if they haven’t read it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_delete_a_text_sent_to_the_wrong_person></span><strong>Can you delete a text sent to the wrong person?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you’re talking about email or text messages you’ve sent to the wrong person, yes, you can delete them off of your device.
