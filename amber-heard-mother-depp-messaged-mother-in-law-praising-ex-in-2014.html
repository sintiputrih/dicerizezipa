Depp's lawyers have argued the article implied that their client is Heard's abuser and derailed his Hollywood career. As <a href=#>court proceedings</a> resumed on Monday, April 25, Heard's attorney <a href=#>Ben Rottenborn</a> revealed how Depp was going into detox for addiction to pain killers when he exchanged messages with Heard’s mother.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=#>Where is Bianca Butti?

"I am beyond thankful to have you in my life. There’s no luckier man on this earth to have the strength that Amber gives me and the full support of each of you individually that I’ve gotten helps immeasurably," he added.</p><p>“I don’t need to explain the horrors to you. You know as well as I," he continued. "What you do need to know – is that your daughter has risen far above the nightmarish task of taking care of this poor, old junkie. Never a second has gone by that she didn’t look out for me or have her eyes on me to make sure that I was okay. Words are truly feeble in attempting to explain her heroism in a text. Suffice to say that I have never met, or loved, a woman or a thing, more.” Depp concluded by saying, “She has the strength of a thousand men and that is due to no one or nothing but you, sweetheart. Thank you. I love you. Your son-outlaw.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/6623d2e4-6299-425a-928f-9bda24ab56a9.486494174><h2 class=split>Who is Amber Heard's mother?</h2><p>Amber Heard's biological mother Paige Heard (née Parsons) was born in Midland, Texas on October 1, 1956. She gave birth to Amber on April 22, 1986, and raised her and her sister Whitney in Austin Texas, with her husband David Clinton Heard. Amber's father is known as an actor, notably for his roles in ‘Machete Kills’ which was released in 2013, and ‘Overhaulin” in 2004. Not much is known about Paige's professional life. Some reports describe her as an Internet researcher, but that hasn't been verified.</p><p>Amber left the household at the age of 17 to pursue acting in New York. Despite being away from home, the 'Aquaman' star has always enjoyed a close bond with her mother. In May 2020, the actress revealed on Instagram that her beloved mom had died. Taking to Instagram, Amber wrote an emotional tribute to Paige while sharing a black and white photo of the mother and daughter smiling and hugging, as well as a throwback snap of a young Paige holding baby Amber in her arms.</p><p>"I am heartbroken and devastated beyond belief at the loss of my mom, Paige Heard," the actress wrote at the time. "She left us too early, clasping onto the memory of her beautiful, gentle soul. She will be missed from the very depths of our hearts forever. Her unflinching, open heart made her the most beautiful woman I had ever known." She added, "It’s hard to imagine and even more difficult to say but I feel truly lucky to have been her daughter and been given the gift of having the light she shone on everyone, fall on me for nearly 34 years."</p><p>Amber often posted photos with her mother on Instagram, with the latest being a selfie with her and her sister Whitney celebrating International Women's Day. "Happy International Women’s Day, a day dedicated to all you badass women warriors out there," she wrote in the caption.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZ2XsrN5x56Yq5xdory1tMSrZJ2doKV6rrHSrJignZRiurDAx56pZqGeYrmiw4ypqZqho567qHnEsWSipl1nfXKA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20091008889.html><span>←</span><span>Ruby Dee - Biography</span></a>
