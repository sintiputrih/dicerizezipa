Not only is Kevin starring in the film, but he’s also a director, and apparently sank a lot of his own money into the production.</p><p>The insider claimed that if the project is a hit, Kevin’s friends believe he’ll get a spring back in his step. But if it tanks, it could further impact the actor’s well-being.</p><p>“There’s such a thing as giving TOO MUCH of yourself to a movie project, and that’s what’s happened to Kevin here,” they explained. “Friends worry about Kevin because of the wars he’s been through in the last year and a half: his marriage ending, his fight with the Yellowstone bosses and the monumental battle to get Horizon: An American Saga made.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not only Costner’s huge project that’s apparently taking a toll on him.

Costner, who played the lead role, clashed with Sheridan over the demanding production timelines and his desire to focus on other projects.</p><p>“Everybody has their limits, even somebody as self-reliant as Kevin, and you can see how hard he’s pushed himself when you spend a little time with him in person. His plans for this summer are extremely ambitious, but does he really have the energy to execute them? That’s an open question right now,” the source continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-rsquo-s-ex-wife-is-dating-a-family-friend>Kevin’s Ex-Wife Is Dating A Family Friend</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Another stressor in Kevin’s life may be his ex-wife’s new relationship. Though they’ve been rumored to be together for months – even before her divorce from Kevin was finalized – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine finally confirmed her relationship with family friend Joshua Connor.</a></p><p>Christine and Kevin were married in 2004 and welcomed three children before she filed for divorce last year. Despite having a prenup, the pair argued over the division of their assets, though Christine eventually got less in spousal and child support than she had wanted.
