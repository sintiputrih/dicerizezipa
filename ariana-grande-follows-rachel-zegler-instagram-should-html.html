In this production, Zegler acted alongside Rita Moreno, Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, and Ansel Elgort.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_27>This West Side Story performer has a few well-known friends, including To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before actor Noah Centineo and her co-star Josh Andrés Rivera.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_43>When Zegler earned the part of <a href=#>Snow White</a> in Disney’s live-action adaptation, <a href=#>Auli’i Cravalho</a>, the voice of Disney’s Moana, shared her support on Twitter.

In one set of tweets, the West Side Story actor showcased some of her best celebrity impersonations. She made the droid noise from Star Wars and even quoted United States Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_36>Their third <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> featured an impression of Cat from Victorious (portrayed by Ariana Grande.) Over a year later, fans noticed that Zegler follows Grande on Instagram. Additionally, the “Thank U, Next” singer is following Zegler back.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_34>However, it’s unclear if these artists ever met in person, although Grande is a known fan of everything musical theater-related. Grande will appear in the movie adaptation of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, Wicked.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-rachel-zegler-often-shares-her-love-for-grammy-award-winning-artist-and-a-star-is-born-actor-lady-gaga>Rachel Zegler often shares her love for Grammy Award-winning artist, and ‘A Star is Born’ actor Lady Gaga</h2><p id=par-8_52>Aside from her love for musical theater, Zegler gushes over several artists, from Glen Hansard to Taylor Swift. Zegler is also a “Little Monster.” She often covers some of Lady Gaga’s best-known songs and once emulated the “father, son, and House of Gucci” quote popularized by the A Star is Born actor.</p><p id=par-9_38>Some even credit a viral Twitter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> of Zegler belting “Shallow” in an empty auditorium as a reason why she earned the part of María. Zegler later confirmed this isn’t true, saying the audition process lasted several months.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_56>“I think it’s not lost on a lot of us that she saved so many lives with her music and her unapologetic self-everything,” Zegler said during an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ExtraTV</a>. “She was just unapologetic about who she was, and it’s been very inspiring for me also to watch her transition into a highly acclaimed actress.”</p><p id=par-11_27>“She’s amazing, and she can do it all,” Zegler continued. “And she is the definition of someone who inspires the next generation. I was inspired by her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSus7XAp5hmn6KWu6WxjJ%2BmpaSfrMBuvsCcn56kXa%2ByqLjEq2SipqOprqi%2BwKZkrKCfqrmlesetpKVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-bj-griffin-agt-5136091.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is BJ Griffin?
