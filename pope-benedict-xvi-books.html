He attended the Aschau am Inn elementary school, which was renamed in his honor in 2009.</p><p>His family, particularly his father, despised the Nazis, and his father’s opposition to Nazism resulted in family demotions and harassment.</p><p>He was conscripted into the Hitler Youth after his 14th birthday in 1941, as membership was required by law for all 14-year-old German boys after March 1939, but he was an unenthusiastic member who refused to attend meetings, according to his brother.</p><p>In November 1945, he and his brother Georg entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein, and later studied at the Ducal Georgianum of the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich.</p><p>They were both ordained on June 29, 1951, in Freising by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber of Munich, whom Ratzinger had met as a child.</p><p>His dissertation on Augustine of Hippo, titled The People and the House of God in Augustine’s Doctrine of the Church, was completed in 1953. His habilitation (qualification for a professorship) was completed at Bonaventure.</p><p>It was completed in 1957, and he began teaching at Freising College in 1958. Pope Benedict was deeply influenced by the ideas of Italian German Romano Guardini, who taught in Munich from 1946 to 1951 while studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich.</p><p>The intellectual affinity between these two thinkers, who would later become decisive figures for the twentieth-century Catholic Church, was preoccupied with rediscovering the essentials in Christianity: Guardini wrote The Essence of Christianity in 1938, while Ratzinger wrote Introduction to Christianity in 1968, three decades later.</p><p>In 1951, he began working as a chaplain at the parish of St. Martin, Moosach, in Munich. Pope Benedict became a professor at the University of Bonn in 1959, with his inaugural lecture on “The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy”.</p><p>He transferred to the University of Münster in 1963. During this time, he was a peritus (theological consultant) to Cardinal Frings of Cologne and attended the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965).</p><p>He was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising on March 24, 1977, and ordained a bishop on May 28, 1977. Cooperatores veritatis (Latin for “cooperators of the truth”), from the Third Epistle of John, became his episcopal motto, a choice on which he commented in his autobiographical work Milestones.</p><p>At the age of 78, Benedict XVI was elected as the 265th Pope. Since Pope Clement XII, he is the oldest person to be elected Pope (1730–1740). He was a cardinal for longer before becoming Pope than any other Pontiff since Benedict XIII (1724–1730).</p><p>Benedict and his Polish predecessor John Paul II were the first non-Italian popes to reign consecutively since the Avignon Papacy’s seven consecutive Frenchmen (1309–1378). Benedict XV, an Italian who reigned from 1914 to 1922 during World War I, was the last Pope named Benedict (1914–1918).</p><p>He chose the pontifical name Benedict, which comes from the Latin word for “blessed,” to honor both Benedict XV and Benedict of Nursia.</p><p>During the First World War, Pope Benedict XV worked tirelessly to bring peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the Benedictine monasteries (the Benedictine order was responsible for the majority of monasteries in the Middle Ages) and the author of the Rule of Saint Benedict, which is still the most influential work on the monastic life in Western Christianity.</p><p>Benedict made only minor changes to the Roman Curia’s structure. In March 2006, he appointed Cardinal Renato Martino as president of both the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.</p><p>When Martino retired in 2009, each council was given its own president for the first time. Under Cardinal Paul Poupard, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue was briefly merged into the Pontifical Council for Culture in March 2006.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pope Benedict XVI Books: Books Written By Pope Benedict XVI</h2><p>Aside from being a religious leader, Pope Benedict was also an author. As an author, he authored several books and some of the books that he authored are The Spirit of the Liturgy, Called to Communion: Understanding the Church Today, and the Last Testament: In His Own Words.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqmmqZ1dl7KvscOimq1lqKu2bq7OqKKsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./net-worth-height-family-and-boyfriend-of-nita-strauss.html><span>←</span><span>Net Worth, Height, Family, and Boyfriend of Nita Strauss</span></a>
