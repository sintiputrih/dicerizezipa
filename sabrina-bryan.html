While touring, The Cheetah Girls began work on their official debut studio album. Bryan was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where she stated that the group was eager to showcase a "more mature" sound to gather an audience of older fans, while still keeping the lyrics clean for the younger fanbase as well. Williams was quoted as saying that the band members co-produced and co-wrote a "good portion" of the album. On September 25, 2007, TCG was released by Hollywood Records, with a debut of No. 44 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It was the first album by the group to not be released by Walt Disney Records. 126,000 copies have been sold to date.</p><p>Bryan received her lowest score, a 25 for a foxtrot, during Week 6, in which she also performed a Rock 'n' Roll routine with the other contestants. That week, she was voted off. The announcement was met by shock and tears from the show's judges, contestants and live audience, since she and Ballas were favored by many to win the competition. An AOL poll voted their elimination "2007's most shocking TV moment." The next week, the remaining dancers and celebrities showed their continued support and affection for Bryan by donning her signature cheetah paw-print tattoo. For the penultimate week, Bryan and Ballas were invited back to the show to perform, another first for any couple as previously non-competition dances had only been performed by pro dancers. For the 100th show, their Paso Doble was chosen as number 9 on the top 10 dances of the first five seasons. Bryan and Ballas were the only couple in the top 10 that did not make it to the finals.</p><p>The Cheetah Girls 2 premiered on the Disney Channel on August 25, 2006. Its premiere received the highest ratings of all Disney Channel Movies at its time, bringing in a total of over 8.1&nbsp;million viewers, beating both the premiere ratings of High School Musical (7.7&nbsp;million) and the previous highest rated DCOM record holder, Cadet Kelly (7.8&nbsp;million). The film would also become the highest rated Cheetah Girls movie in the trilogy. The sequel's plot followed the Cheetah Girls as they become largely successful and take a tour of Spain. The film's soundtrack was released on August 15, 2006. It debuted at #5 on the Billboard 200, and has moved over 1.4&nbsp;million copies to date, achieving platinum status.</p><p>Due to the popularity of the film, Bryan and her other bandmates achieved mainstream pop music success as members of the official Cheetah Girls group. The movie's soundtrack reached No. 33 on the Billboard 200 and was certified double-platinum, selling more than 2 million copies in the United States alone. It is one of the best selling albums from Walt Disney Records, alongside the soundtrack to High School Musical. In November 2005, the group released their Christmas album, Cheetah-licious Christmas, and toured the US on their Cheetah-licious Christmas Tour.</p><p>In 2003, Bryan starred as Dorinda "Do" Thomas in the Disney Channel Original Movie The Cheetah Girls, a musical comedy based on the bestselling series of young adult books of the same name by Deborah Gregory. The film depicts four best friends (Raven-Symoné, <a href=#>Adrienne Bailon</a>, <a href=#>Kiely Williams</a>, and Bryan) who form a pop group in their first year of high school for a talent show and reach unexpected success. Prior to The Cheetah Girls, two of Bryan's castmates Bailon and Williams were members of R&B girl group 3LW.
