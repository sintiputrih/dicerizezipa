Lenny has also appeared in several film and television projects, such as “Precious” (2009), “The Hunger Games” (2012), and the FX series “Better Things” (2016). In 2011, Kravitz accepted France’s highest honor, becoming an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Lenny Kravitz married to?</h2><p>Backstage at a New Edition concert in California in 1985, Kravitz met Cosby Show actress Lisa Bonet. They were close friends for two years before getting together. <a href=# rel=noopener>Leonard Kravitz</a> returned to New York City, where The Cosby Show was produced, in 1987 to live with Bonet. On November 16, 1987, her 20th birthday, they eloped and married in a Las Vegas ceremony.</p><p>Kravitz, who was still known as Romeo Blue at the time, found himself in tabloid headlines. On December 1, 1988, he and Bonet welcomed a daughter, Zo Isabella Kravitz, who went on to become an actress, singer, and model. In 1991, Kravitz and Bonet divorced. In 1993, they separated amicably.</p><p>From 1991 to 1996, Kravitz dated French singer and model Vanessa Paradis. In 2001, he began dating Brazilian model Adriana Lima, and they lived together before becoming engaged in 2002. The engagement ended in August 2003. Lima appeared in Kravitz’s music video for “Yesterday Is Gone (My Dear Kay)” in 2002. From 2003 to 2004, he dated and was engaged to Australian actress Nicole Kidman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Lenny Kravitz religious faith?</h2><p>Kravitz identifies as a Christian in religious terms “by choice,” but adds, “I’m also a Jew.” To me, it’s all the same.” He stated in another interview, “I’m half Jewish, half black, and I look in-between.” He also mentions spirituality as “an important issue in [his] growth,” considering his upbringing by parents of various faiths.</p><p>Such religiosity is evident in several of his tracks, such as the lyrics on his album Baptism and a tattoo on his back that reads “My Heart Belongs to Jesus Christ.” He declared in 2011 that his 2005 religious resolve to stay celibate until remarriage had not changed. However, in a 2014 interview with Men’s Health, he changed his mind.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are some of Lenny Kravitz asses?</h2><p>He currently owns a property in Paris, a farm compound in Brazil, and a caravan in the Bahamas with surrounding acreage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2grJufq7KzedOhnGaolafAsLrApWSloZaaerCyjKWcp6apYrizrdWiq7NlmJ7AbrnAq6mimZeaerOxy6KeoqelqHqnrcitn2aZnpl6or%2FSnqqsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amd-threadripper-x399-motherboards.html><span>←</span><span>ASUS ROG Strix X399-E Gaming</span></a>
