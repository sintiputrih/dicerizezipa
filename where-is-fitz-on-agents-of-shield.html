However, when Deke Shaw (Jeff Ward) saw the Chronicom performing surgery on Jemma, he immediately knocked him out.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>When Jemma came to, she revealed to Deke that Enoch was helping to fix her memory so they could fix the ship. She also revealed: &nbsp;"You cannot imagine how impossible it was to track the Chronicoms through time, but Fitz and I found a place where all their moves could be observed. To guide us, Fitz stayed there. He is completely exposed and they will kill him if they find him, so no one can know his location."&nbsp;</p><p>The biochemist also revealed that she does indeed know her husband's location, but designed an implant to help suppress her memories, which she named Diana.</p><p>Jemma explained to her grandson that she's worried about remembering Fitz's location, which would put him in danger. Adding, "Diana is acting up, and I'm forgetting the things I'm supposed to know and, more dangerously, I'm remembering the things I'm not."</p><p>So, while viewers are still unsure of Fitz's exact location, Jemma's small clue seemed to suggest that he is at the mercy of the Chronicoms.
