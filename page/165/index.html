Hold on, to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave is stringing us along
Just know you're not alone
Cause I'm going to make this place your homeSettle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found
Just know you're not alone</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Acer Shows Off 2880x1620 Panel</h2><time>Jan 28, 2024</time>

The panel as noted is 2880x1620, with a diagonal of around 15.6" (give or take 0.1" I'd guess). This is basically the non-Apple version of the QWXGA+ display, only in 16:9 attire rather than 16:10.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cul es el animal ms peligroso de Michigan?
