Celebrity Big Brother seems a bit of an odd one. You wouldn’t assume that the winning celeb would take home a tangible prize, right? They’re celebrities, after all.
In most other celebrity competition shows (Masterchef, I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here etc), the winner doesn’t actually receive any extra prize money.
Toff from Made in Chelsea won I’m a Celeb but the only money she earnt from the series was the fee paid to her for entering the jungle – a fee all celebs get regardless of where they finish in the competition.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Coroner IDs deceased victim of mass shooting at Indiana County community center</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>
