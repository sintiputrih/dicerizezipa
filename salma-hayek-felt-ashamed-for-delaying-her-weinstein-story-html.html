The Times approached her to write it, but the experience initially upset her. “I started crying when they asked and I ended up not doing it,” the actor said. “And then I felt ashamed that I was a coward. I was supporting women for two decades and then I was a coward.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjde1k5k7001d3k61u5th8449@published data-word-count=60>Hayek’s essay alleged that Weinstein repeatedly propositioned her. She says that after she declined his advances, the movie mogul embarked on a campaign to sabotage her movie Frida, which was backed by Weinstein’s production company Miramax. He allegedly <a href=#>demanded Hayek do a gratuitous sex scene</a> in the movie and then, once it was made, fought to not release the film.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjde1xe6l001i3k61taagurze@published data-word-count=20>Hayek’s Frida co-star Ashley Judd has been one of <a href=#>Weinstein’s most vocal accusers</a>.
