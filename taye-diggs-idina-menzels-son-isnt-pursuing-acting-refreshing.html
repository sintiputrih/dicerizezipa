So that’s been very, very refreshing.”</p><p>Diggs and Menzel, also 49, welcomed Walker in 2009, six&nbsp;years after they tied the knot in Jamaica. The former Rent costars have been <a href=#>coparenting</a> him since <a href=#>splitting in 2014</a>.</p><p>“We have a very easy time, I think,” Diggs told Us of their dynamic. “We never make a wrong step because we’re always thinking of Walker first. We both love Walker and want what’s best for him. I think once you do that, it allows for things to be a little bit easier.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>It helps that Walker is “such a good kid” and “so active,” Diggs gushed. “It’s been pretty easy up to this point so we’re very grateful.”</p><p>While hanging at home with his son amid the coronavirus pandemic, the pair have been swimming and having “great conversations.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Taye-Diggs-Idina-Menzel-Son-Doesnt-Feel-Need-Follow-Their-Footsteps-002.jpg><p>Thanks to <a href=#>Quaker Chewy’s Camp Chewy</a>, some of the pressure is off of Diggs to entertain Walker during quarantine. “[This program will help] recreate the summer camp experience right at home,” he said. “All people have to do is go to a website, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable>NoCampNoProblem.com</a>. You can sign up for a sweepstakes to win up to $250 worth of really cool prizes … that encourage play time with the family at home.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatmamaeqW1xqCqZqGUnruiecyepbOdnKh6tLvNZqCspqRivba%2B0q6gp59dlrC1tc2gZKudlqeytLTIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-han-bin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-521780-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Han-bin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
