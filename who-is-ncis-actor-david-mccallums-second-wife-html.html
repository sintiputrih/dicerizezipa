McCallum has spoken about he felt about the Death Wish star stealing his wife.</p><p id=par-5_39>“I never hated him, Charlie was always a good friend,” McCallum said. “I find that when problems come along, worrying about them and getting anxious and negative is quite unnecessary. You can solve them, usually amicably. That’s what happened.”</p><p id=par-6_20>McCallum and Ireland had three children together and the actor admitted that did make the situation tough on him.</p><p id=par-7_17><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="telling The Mirror (opens in a new tab)" href=#>He told The Mirror</a>, “It was an extremely difficult time, not least because we had three children.”</p><p id=par-8_20>Following his split with Ireland, McCallum met Carpenter, who worked as a fashion model for a number of years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/David-McCallum-and-his-wife-Katherine-Carpenter.jpg><p id=par-9_31>The pair wed in 1967, the same year his divorce from Ireland was finalized.

Things remind you of the loss, birthdays and things. But it’s gone, it’s done. He’s not coming back, so I don’t dwell on it.”</p><p id=par-14_31>These days, McCallum is enjoying spending time with his family and is thrilled with the success of NCIS as it still remains one of the most-watched shows on network television.</p><p id=par-15_12>“The best moment of my life is right now,” he said.</p><p id=par-16_23>In addition to acting, McCallum also authored a book titled Once a Crooked Man.
