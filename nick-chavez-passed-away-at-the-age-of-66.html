His family expressed their grief in a heartfelt letter that read:</strong></p><p>“We regret to inform you that our dear brother, uncle, cousin, and friend, Nick Chavez, died today at his Beverly Hills home after a long and valiant battle with pancreatic cancer.”</p><p>Nick, who is originally from Arizona, began his career as a hairstylist in Southern California, where he apprenticed under a well-known hairdresser who catered to many celebrities and high-profile individuals. After working as a model and actor, he opened his own salon in Beverly Hills. Nick also has his own hair care line, Nick Chavez Beverly Hills.</p><h2>Nick Chavez has appeared on the covers of numerous magazines, including Vogue, GQ, Elle, and Esquire</h2><p>The stylist, who was born in Yuma, Arizona in 1956, has always been passionate about beauty, haircare, and spiritual life. His ancestors are Yaqui and Quechan Indians, and his family is Mexican-American. Nick, the second oldest of seven siblings, helped his family on their ranch on a regular basis. Nick Chavez also learned “holistic healing techniques from his Yaqui Grandmother,” according to his official website.</p><p>Nick’s frequent grooming of the family horses piqued his interest in his natural scissor skills, and he soon began creating “cool and fashionable” haircuts for his siblings and extended family. As a young adult, he moved to Southern California in 1977 and began his apprenticeship in a prestigious Beverly Hills salon, quickly graduating as a full-fledged hairdresser.</p><p>His abilities quickly drew attention to him, and he now has a large clientele and an even larger reputation. In his late twenties, the hairdresser put his career on hold to work as a model and actor. He posed for Jean Paul Gaultier, Yves St. Laurent, and Valentino during his European tour.</p><p>Nick’s photo shoots were a success, with several of them appearing on the covers of Vogue, GQ, Elle, and Esquire, as well as a 100-foot billboard in Times Square. He has worked on a variety of television shows, including The Young and the Restless, Hollywood Detectives, and numerous TV commercials. When Nick returned to Beverly Hills in 1997, he opened his own salon, which became an instant success. Among his clients were Margeaux Hemmingway, Lisa Hartmann, and Belinda Carlisle.</p><p>After struggling to find the right products for his customers, Nick founded his own haircare brand, “Nick Chavez Beverly Hills,” in 1999. His goal was to have gorgeous, healthy hair in order to achieve the “Every Day Gorgeous” look. The items are available online as well as through home shopping channels such as QVC in the United States and abroad.</p><p>Nick’s incredible “hair and makeover changes” landed him frequent appearances on talk shows such as E! Fashion Emergency and Extreme Makeovers. In March 2020, Nick has diagnosed with stage two pancreatic cancer. Nick Chavez began chemotherapy in April. He documented his hair loss during chemotherapy and its regrowth on his website. He stated, ”</p><p><strong>“I’ve always believed that life isn’t meant to be spent in pain. What matters is how we respond to suffering.” Self-love is the most effective treatment.”</strong></p><p>Along with his sister, Sandra, Robby LaRiviere, Nick Chavez’s protégé and on-air and media partner, will carry on the brand. Both have contributed significantly to the brand’s product development and innovation.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>entrepreneur</a> <a href=# rel=tag>hairdresser</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Emanuel Bronner</a></h3>Emanuel Bronner estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
