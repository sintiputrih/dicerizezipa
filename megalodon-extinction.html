Then, despite their seven-inch mega-teeth, they vanished.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_1etrtDrYop</a></p><p>For decades, scientists have only been able to speculate on what knocked out history’s largest shark (three times the size of today’s great whites). Now, they think they finally know.</p><p>The last ice age is widely believed to have at least partially triggered a large extinction event on land (affecting creatures like ground sloths, saber-toothed cats, woolly mammoths). The dominant theory in the scientific community had been that the massive water creatures living around this same time were less affected by the ice age’s extreme temperature shift.</p><p>But new research from the <a href=#>University of Zurich</a> shows that a previously unknown mass extinction had already changed the seas, killing off up to 55 percent of marine mammals, 43 percent of sea turtles, 35 percent of sea birds, and nine percent of sharks about 2 million years ago, before the ice age even took hold.</p><p>The nature of the extinction event is uncertain, but researchers suggest that it involved habitat loss due to shifting sea levels.</p><p>“It’s astonishing that an extinction event like this, among the biggest animals in the oceans, could go undetected until now,” study co-author Dr. John Griffin, told the <a href=#>ITV network</a>. “It overturns the assumption that the oceans’ biodiversity was resistant to the environmental change in Earth’s recent history.”</p><p>Indeed, some scientists now believe that this mass marine extinction event wiped out the megalodon, as well as giant sea sloths, half of all sea turtle species, and many whales as well.</p><p>These deaths may have also helped trigger the land extinction associated with the ice age. Shifting sea levels along with a difference in marine prey likely caused new kinds of predators to emerge on land as coastal habitats changed.</p><p>The opening in the marine life food chain also paved the way for other creatures to develop, including polar bears and yellow-eyed penguins, which are now thought to be direct results of the newly discovered mass marine extinction.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-119878 alt="Polar Bear" width=900 height=629 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/polar-bear.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-119878 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>VASILY MAXIMOV/AFP/Getty Images</span></p><p>Though this extinction event happened in the very distant past, the historic discovery comes with a warning for our future.</p><p>“This study shows that marine megafauna were far more vulnerable to global environmental changes in the recent geological past than had previously been assumed,” a <a href=#>statement</a> on the study notes. “Nowadays, large marine species such as whales or seals are also highly vulnerable to human influences.”</p><p>The megalodon is long gone, but modern whales and turtles are following a frighteningly similar path to that of their predecessors.</p><p>And if history is indeed to repeat itself, the <a href=#>sixth mass extinction</a> on land would come next.</p><p>After learning about the Megalodon extinction, check out <a href=#>the video</a> that a few brave (or stupid) people took of a great white shark flailing in shallow water. Then, watch <a href=#>police warn unaware paddleboarders that they’re surrounded by great whites</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuscaao6icn6N6psTToqWcrJmkuw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paddy-mcguinness-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-150659-html.html><span>←</span><span>Paddy Mcguinness Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
