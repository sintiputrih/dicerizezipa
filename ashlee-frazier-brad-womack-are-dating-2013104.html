Two of the hit ABC show's former contestants — <strong>AshLee Frazier</strong>, fresh off the most recent season of The Bachelor, and <strong>Brad Womack,</strong> who dumped fiancee <strong>Emily Maynard</strong> weeks after proposing back in March 2011 — are now dating, <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly </strong></a>confirms.</p><p>The pair first met at an event in Texas, and have been happily hanging out ever since, according to an insider. Frazier, 32, even posted a photo of the pair hugging on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> earlier this week.</p><p>"Game day. Who's the real winner here? #Astros #twoTexaskids #wgt," she captioned the shot. Fans immediately responded, asking Frazier if she and Womack were an item.</p><p>Frazier's ex-husband, Andy Barbarow, said that though he doesn't know who Womack is, he's happy for the warm-hearted reality star.&nbsp;</p><p>"Cool…good for her," he told <strong>Us</strong> of the news. "I wish her all the best."</p><p>Frazier famously left her season of The Bachelor without so much as a word to Bachelor <strong>Sean Lowe </strong>after he sent her packing from Thailand just ahead of the final two.</p><p>"He'd been telling me, 'You're going to meet my family. You and my sister are going to be best friends,'" the personal organizer told host <strong>Chris Harrison </strong>on The Women Tell All special in March. "So this whole time, I'm thinking, 'Huh, I got this.' And then all of a sudden I didn't."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now, however, the Houston native is cuddling up to another Bachelor hunk — 39-year-old Womack, who first made headlines on season 11 of the show when he dumped both <strong>DeAnna Pappas </strong>and <strong>Jenni Croft </strong>at the finale, opting to go home empty-handed rather than drop to one knee.</p><p>Womack reemerged for another go in the franchise for season 15, when he narrowed the bevy of beauties down to <strong>Chantal O'Brien</strong> and Maynard and ultimately popped the question to Maynard.</p><p>The pair were engaged, but Womack pulled the plug on the relationship in June 2011, saying in a later interview that he "dodged a bullet with that relationship."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaq5ihsqZ5xauYs6GVp3qjvsCdZLCnnZawrHnAq5xmnJGptq%2BzjGtnamthZYFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./128455-15-easy-diy-gifts-to-make-for-your-favorite-book-nerd.html><span>←</span><span>15 Easy DIY Gifts To Make For Your Favorite Book Nerd</span></a>
