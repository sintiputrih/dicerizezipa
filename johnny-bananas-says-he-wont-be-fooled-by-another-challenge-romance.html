Fool me twice, you’re not gonna fool me again,” Johnny, 41, exclusively told<i> Us Weekly </i>on Tuesday, August 8, while promoting his upcoming stint on<a href=#> <i>The Challenge USA </i></a>season 2. “You know, they say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result. Well, call me insane. I think one of the issues with [a showmance] is there’s just a lot of [questions about], ‘What <a href=#>is the actual intention here behind</a> — is this for show? Is this for likes? Is this for clout?’ And unfortunately, more often than not, that tends to be the case.”</p><p class=p1>The MTV personality — who has <a href=#>won seven seasons of the OG competition</a> — further explained that “it’s just not a good look” to enter into an on-camera relationship.</p><p class=p1>“It <a href=#>leads to way more headaches</a> than I need,” Johnny said. “I’ve got enough to worry about on this show. Last thing I need to do is also start intermixing my personal life with it as well. It never ends well, and it only is gonna make your game more complicated because now you — nine times out of 10, if you get into a showmance on a show — are<a href=#> now taking ownership of this other person’s game</a> as well and are viewed in almost as in like, some sort of an alliance.”</p><p class=p1>He added: “Females are gonna look at it like, ‘Oh, well, you know, Bananas is with this girl, that means that they’re working together or vice versa.’ The guys are gonna be like, ‘All right, well, we need to get rid of him because they’re [a unit], and if they get messy, and if their game gets messy,’ then it’s, like, you’re kind of now responsible for [the gameplay drama] as well.”</p><p>Johnny has had his fair share of <a href=#>steamy<i> Challenge</i> dalliances</a> over the years with the likes of <a href=#><strong>Morgan Willett</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Natalie Negrotti</strong></a> and <strong>Moriah Jadea</strong>. But this time around, he’s laser-focused on “the ultimate prize at the end” of the competition.</p><p class=p1>“Once you kind of start getting distracted [and] once <a href=#>you lose focus on what the ultimate goal</a> is, it’s sure to not end well,” Johnny told <i>Us</i>. “But I encourage everybody else to continue on with these meaningless, nonsensical showmances, and then I’ll just be there to pick up the pieces when it all falls apart.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Johnny-Bananas-Devenanzio-Says-He-s-Steering-Clear-of-Challenge-Romances-Fool-Me-Once-379.jpg><p class=p1>While Johnny is steering clear of a showmance, he had a front row seat to <a href=#><strong>Tori Deal</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Sebastian Noel</strong></a>’s own fling that was briefly highlighted in the season trailer.</p><p class=p1>“We all know Tori <a href=#>loves herself some company</a> on <i>The Challenge, </i>and I think it was a great play for Sebastian,” Johnny said, noting he wasn’t surprised by the new pairing. “I mean, listen, this guy’s coming in as a rookie [and] what better way to find protection and also get a great storyline right outta the gate than falling into a showmance with pretty much the female face of <i>The Challenge</i> at this point? I mean, we call that ‘polidicking’ on <i>The Challenge</i>. So, well played Sebastian, well played.”</p><p class=p1>While a reality TV romance was not in the cards for Johnny this year, he did find the competition itself “challenged me in ways that no other <i>Challenge</i> has before” because of <a href=#>the format and the “level of talent”</a> of his costars.</p><p class=p1>“The learning curve for this season was very steep, but in a way, it was good,” Johnny explained. “It was a good challenge for me because it was <a href=#>really competing against some of the best</a> and most strategic minds in the game. If you’re able to thrive and rise to the occasion on that, it’s a true testament to your ability. It was a good time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>The Challenge USA </i>season 2 kicks off with a two-part premiere on CBS on Thursday, August 10 at 10 p.m. ET and Sunday, August 13 at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGooJ6jxm6uwKeYp5mjYsCixdJmn55lp6S7tXnBnmSfp5%2BhsqV5wbJkmqafqbWmvoycn5qknJq7qLGMq6ammZ6YsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eric-church-coming-to-st-louis-in-july.html><span>←</span><span>Eric Church coming to St. Louis in July</span></a>
