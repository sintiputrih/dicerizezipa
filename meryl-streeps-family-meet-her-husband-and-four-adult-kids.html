Not only is Meryl the mom of four kids, but she is also a loving wife to her husband of more than 40 years, Don Gummer.</p><p>The pair tied the knot in September 1978 and later welcomed their three daughters, <a href=#><strong>Mamie Gummer</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Grace Gummer</strong></a> and <strong>Louisa Gummer</strong>, and their only son, <strong>Henry Gummer</strong>.&nbsp;But in March 2019, Meryl’s family got a little bigger when Mamie <a href=#>welcomed her first child</a> with her partner, producer <strong>Mehar Sethi</strong>.</p><p>Months after the baby’s arrival in August 2019, Meryl’s other daughter Grace separated from musician <strong>Tay Strathairn</strong> after 42 days of marriage. When their <a href=#>divorce was finalized</a> in August 2020, the judge granted Grace the keys to their NYC apartment, her trust and more. As for Tay, he got to keep his 1986 Toyota truck, 2015 Jeep, various bank accounts and several more belongings.</p><p>It was a bittersweet love story for Grace and Tay, who fell in love in the summer of 2017. Meryl <a href=#>tried to console her daughter</a>, even though she “[loved] Tay and his parents,” a source told Closer Weekly at the time their split was finalized. “She’s sad about this, but she is completely, as she is with all of her kids, in Grace’s corner.”</p><p>The Iron Lady star told her daughter that marriage is “a balancing act, especially when you have a job that you consider rewarding,” the source said, and she told Mamie something similar when the blonde beauty divorced her first husband, <strong>Benjamin Walker</strong>, in 2013 after two years of marriage.</p><p>Because Meryl has gained so much wisdom over the years, she makes sure to pass down her best advice to her children. “She is a safe haven for them — she trusts them to make their own choices and be smart,” the insider told Closer.</p><p>“Family has always come first” for the It’s Complicated alum, so she constantly chooses her kids over her Hollywood career. Thanks to her unwavering dedication to her family, Meryl has created an unbreakable bond with her brood. “They’re connected,” the source said.</p><p><strong>To learn more about Meryl and Don’s Oscar-nominated family, scroll through the gallery below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mnKuxnGLAtb7EnqesZZaWuqq42Gaknp2kYrWmvoyhrKyakaOxbq3NnWSfp6WneqKw1KWrZqOZmcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juliana-cannarozzo-net-worth-241738.html><span>←</span><span>Juliana Cannarozzo Net Worth</span></a>
