This has been very uncommon in the Triple H creative regime since taking over creative for the company in late July.</p><p>These changes continued well into the show and reportedly came directly from Mr. McMahon, who, once again, has his own office backstage at the show. Multiple sources at RAW last night informed Johnson that there was “no doubt that Vince was firmly back in charge.”</p><p>While Triple H started the night running headsets for RAW, McMahon became “more and more involved” as the person running the show as the episode went on. The former <a href=#>WWE</a> owner was seen in the gorilla position for the majority of last night’s show overseeing the product.</p><p>Talents who spoke with Johnson last night sighted a “huge negative shift in morale” as things had reverted to how they were before Triple H took over creative last July. One person went as far as to say that things felt “nuked.”</p><p>Other talents took a much more realistic approach stating that they always expected this to happen eventually but hoped that this wouldn’t be a regular thing going forward.</p><p>All eyes will now turn to SmackDown this Friday to see if Vince McMahon is backstage running the show again or not.</p><p><a href=#>Vince McMahon Explains Why He Is Selling WWE, If He’ll Be Involved In Creative</a></p><p>What do you make of this news?
