While there may be some families full of talent, it's often the case that just one of the children in a household is a shining Hollywood star, while&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the others might pale in comparison.</a> This is a tough spot to be in.&nbsp;Sometimes the other sibling will truly do their best to achieve their own level of success, but they just can't achieve the same recognition or traction as their famous sibling. Living in the shadows of a famous sibling is something the following people seem to have struggled with...</p><h2 id=frankie-jonas><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Frankie Jonas</span></h2><p>While it's no secret that Kevin, Joe, and Nick Jonas are part of the wildly successful music band The Jonas Brothers, they seem to have left a soldier behind. There is actually a 4th Jonas brother, and his name is Frankie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a group, the Jonas Brothers have a net worth of a whopping $150 million, and chances are, Frankie is feeling a wee bit left out. While he has pursued his own career in acting and was the voice of&nbsp;S≈çsuke in the animated film, Ponyo, he never really took off in the manner that his brothers did. The "Bonus Jonas" has only recently gained traction on TikTok but still lives in the shadow of his far wealthier, far more famous brothers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Millie Bobby Brown's Older Siblings, And What Do They Do?</a></span></p><h2 id=anwar-hadid><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Anwar Hadid</span></h2><p>Anwar Hadid is definitely the lesser known sibling in the uber-wealthy Hadid family. His father is real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid, and his model-mother is the gorgeous Yolanda Hadid. Anwar grew up in the lap of luxury alongside his sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid, but somehow, he's the only sibling that isn't filthy rich and internationally known. Both of his sisters have launched wildly successful modeling careers and are among the highest paid models in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anwar launched his own jewelry company called Martyre, but his claim to fame is his family name, and the fact that he is currently dating Dua Lipa.&nbsp; Many people don't realize the Hadid sisters even have a third sibling.</p><h2 id=rob-kardashian><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rob Kardashian</span></h2><p>Forever living in the shadows of his very famous, incredibly outspoken sisters, Rob Kardashian seems eager to pursue his business ventures and participate in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Kardashian empire</a> but just can't keep up with their level of super stardom. Being the only male&nbsp;among a group of five powerful women often makes Rob Kardashian pale in comparison. In spite of starring in Keeping Up With The Kardashians and spinning off in his own direction, it seems the world is far more interested in what his sisters say and do, than any sort of adventure he tries to embark on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jamie-lynn-spears><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jamie-Lynn Spears</span></h2><p>Jamie Lynn Spears will always be known as "Britney's little sister," and no matter how she tries to pave her own path, her sister's level of fame simply cannot be matched. <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears</a></strong> has such a dedicated, loyal fan base that Jamie Lynn can't compete with. She had a stint on Nickelodeon's Zoey 101 when she was younger, but her teenage pregnancy inevitably meant her career had to be shelved, and it never really grew wings after that. Try as she may to seek her own identity, she will forever be viewed as a vessel to obtain information about her much more famous sister, Britney Spears.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Kardashian Admitted To Having A Crush On Their Sibling As A Kid?</a></span></p><h2 id=luke-hemsworth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Luke Hemsworth</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth has seen wild success with the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></strong> films, and his brother Liam has gone on to star in Hunger Games, Knowing, and Independence Day, among other big titles. While the world may be very familiar with these two Hemsworth boys, there is one other brother that gets far less attention. Luke has dabbled in the Hollywood scene as well, and has had roles in the television shows Neighbours and Westworld, but he has never been able to soar to the heights of success that his brothers have seen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trent-olsen><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Trent Olsen</span></h2><p>As the oldest of the Olsen kids, Trent has watched Mary-Kate, Ashley, and Elizabeth rise to fame with their acting careers but has&nbsp;lived a much quieter lifestyle himself. He has incredible talent as a pianist and has carved out a very lucrative career writing comic books. Sources reveal that as the writer and artist for&nbsp;John Carpenter's Asylum and John Carpenter's Tales for a Halloween Night, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trent has pursued his own ambitions</a> but will never be recognized for his work in the same manner that his sisters have been.</p><h2 id=casey-affleck><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Casey Affleck</span></h2><p>Being the brother of Ben Affleck can't be easy for Casey. After all, Ben isn't the only actor in the family, he just happens to be the most famous one. Many fans are unaware of the fact that Casey began his acting career as a very young child, and has continued to pursue acting roles through his adulthood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources reveal that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has won an Academy Award</a> for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for Manchester by the Sea , as well as a Golden Globe award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama also for Manchester by the Sea. Sadly, despite his successful contributions to the world of film, he doesn't seem to resonate in the public sphere.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Bruno Mars' Five Siblings?</a></span></p><h2 id=ashlee-simpson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ashlee Simpson</span></h2><p>Jessica Simpson has seen success as a singer, an actress, and even as an author, but her sister Ashlee hasn't quite been able to achieve the same level of fame. She's been so stuck in the shadow of her older sister that she even released a song called "Shadow" that discusses her struggles to achieve her own identity and fame.</p><p>Ashlee seemed to be getting close to finding success in the world of music, until she was exposed for lip syncing on Saturday Night Live back in 2004, and she's never been able to regain the respect of the public or regain her momentum since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=solange-knowles><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Solange Knowles</span></h2><p>Solange Knowles is <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce</a></strong>'s younger sister, and she will always been regarded in that sense. Finding it difficult to carver her own path in life, Solange tried climbing to fame by writing music for her sister, as well as for Kelly Rowland, but she has never been as recognized or been as embraced by the media as her sister. It must be wildly challenging to be compared to her ultra-famous and incredibly powerful sister.</p><h2 id=noah-cyrus><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Noah Cyrus</span></h2><p>Noah Cyrus has inserted herself into the public sphere in a manner that ensures she is recognized by the press but not enough so that she has been recognized for anything specific. Other than being known as the sister of the incredibly successful <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus</a></strong>, Noah hasn't been able to cultivate her own identity or connect with fans on a personal level. She has appeared alongside her sister on many occasions and has tried her luck on the microphone, but she can't get away from constantly being compared to Miley, which always leaves her in the shadows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Of The Hadid Siblings Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq5meoLamecmopZqrXZa7uK3RZp%2BanJmZeqK6w2amraCVp8BuuMivoKefXZ67bsDHnmSsoJGZvLi%2FjKidZqyYmrazecWapKito2LAqq7LoqWgq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-heat-damage-glasses-lenses.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Can heat damage glasses lenses</span></a>
