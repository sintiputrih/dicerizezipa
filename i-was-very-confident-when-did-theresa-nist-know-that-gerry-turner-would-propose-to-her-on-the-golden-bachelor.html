I said it three times in a row, ‘Theresa, I love you. I love you, I love you’ and I go, ‘I’m going to ask you to marry me. I don’t know if you’re going to say yes, but I’m going to ask you.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>“For me, when I got to the final episode and the engagement was about to happen, I was very confident that she was my person. One hundred percent confident,” he concluded with a beaming smile.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 data-characters=180 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>While both Gerry and Theresa were on the same page that they would get engaged to one another that day, the latter was still unaware whether or not Leslie was still in the picture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 data-characters=183 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>“When she came down the walkway, she didn’t know if she was the first person making that walk or the second person or the only person,” Gerry admitted in the same interview.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, Theresa was confident, revealing that the conversations between her and Gerry in the Fantasy Suite told her everything she needed to know heading into the big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 data-characters=359 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>“What they didn’t see in the Fantasy Suites was everything,” she gushed. “When he presented me with the Fantasy Suite card, I was so enthusiastically accepting it, because I really wanted to go in and delve deeper, and that’s what we did. It was the first time I really showed my true personality to him. He did know, but not as in-depth.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>Naturally, Gerry and Theresa’s time in the Fantasy Suite was equally as pivotal for the Golden Bachelor himself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 data-characters=434 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>“In my head, I had this checklist of four or five things that, ‘I got to know this stuff,’” he dished. “She accepted to go into the Fantasy Suite, and those four or five things, before I even had a chance to ask them, she was like, spouting it out there. She was like, ‘Okay, and this is going to happen, and I want you to know this and this’ and it’s like, ‘Oh my God, we are exactly on the same page.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>As we know, those one-on-one conversations with no camera crew present are what allowed Gerry to determine that Theresa was his perfect match, ultimately leading to their engagement during the tear-jerking finale of The Golden Bachelor.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>To relive the engagement between Gerry and Theresa, you can stream said finale of&nbsp;The Golden Bachelor&nbsp;now via Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqedaaqmaulafGbq%2FOp52inJWjwW7Dx56lZpyZmXq1tMSrnKyZXaO2tMCMpKWor12ptaLAjKCcq6qpYsG2vs2eqWavn6q5pXnPq6app6OaerW7jKGcq2Wfo3q1tMRmnqiklJq7bq7AnJ%2BepJ%2BnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./glodean-white-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-633694-html.html><span>←</span><span>Glodean White Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
