In videos that can stretch longer than a Scorcese double feature, content creators are engaging with their favorite (and least favorite) TV shows like they’re open FBI murder cases, breaking down their component parts and rearranging them to find patterns, memes, inside jokes, conspiracies, philosophical lessons, stannable moments of iconicity, and rant-fodder. It’s now possible to be a fan of a show having only watched it refracted through some kid in a bedroom’s point of view. If you want to know what all the fuss is over a show like <a href=#>The Idol</a> but you have too much dignity and self-respect to make it through The Idol, countless accounts will watch it for you, complete with commentary, Mystery Science Theater 3000–style. (Seriously, there are more hours of YouTube videos about The Idol than there are hours of The Idol.)<strong> </strong>The genre is a good way to catch up on something extremely long running, like Degrassi or Grey’s Anatomy. Or it’s a good way to nostalgically revisit something from your past without actually ruining it by watching it with your adult critical eye … like Degrassi or Grey’s Anatomy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljshyhu9000s3b6x26zhtctz@published data-word-count=74>People have more patience for longform storytelling than ever before — and they want even longer-form storytelling about the storytelling. <a href=#>Mike’s Mic</a> has elevated the form to a new level (and yes, the genre has gone full circle and made its way over to TikTok, with creators like Rob Anderson’s painfully funny, hyper-shortform 7th Heaven recaps).

His series on Pretty Little Liars, Glee, and Gossip Girl upped the production value for this form — he started using elaborate printed-out materials, lending the whole thing a “Pepe Silvia” aesthetic. The joy is in watching him attempt to bring some semblance of grid-like order to some of the most poorly-thought out, bonkers series ever created.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljrgk54c000x3b6x2voiv7h8@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Kennie J.D." href=#>Kennie J.D.</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljrgk54c000y3b6xhqa6jxnf@published data-word-count=19><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 684,000<br><strong>Most-popular recap:</strong> “<a href=#>The dating show where no one should be together | Netflix’s The Ultimatum</a>”<br><strong>Views:</strong> 1 million<br><strong>Length:</strong> 1:03:23</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljrgk54c000z3b6xtmymyyq2@published data-word-count=66>➼ The Beauty YouTuber found a brilliant niche doing makeup tutorials while giving clever movie commentary, but never is she more activated than in her hourlong Love Is Blind recaps and her coverage of The Ultimatum (recently galvanized by the show’s new Queer Love edition).

Her videos hover around 20 minutes and treat obscure flops (Adults Adopting Adults), one-season wonders (First Kill), and popular Netflix shows (Emily in Paris) with equal enthusiasm.

She’s straightforward in production style — Simpson in front of a poster for fully automated luxury gay space communism, talking directly to the camera with some visual aids like clips thrown up onscreen.

The TV rants cover everything from MILF Manor to She-Hulk with the energy and verve of your shit-talking work spouse.

Since then, he’s released extensive recap videos on all the usual subjects: two hours and 40 minutes on The Vampire Diaries, an hour and 20 minutes on Teen Wolf, and many follow-ups on Emily in Paris. His style is pretty pedantic, narrating clips with a sarcastic “Get a load of this” tone, but the channel is popular, and he uploads more consistently than most, including covering more recent series like Wednesday and Euphoria.</p><span class=anchor-span id=reactors></span><h2 class=title><span class=_the>The </span><span class=_reactors>Reactors</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljindk2800a13b6zktj8stgd@published data-word-count=4>We watch them watch.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljindk2800a03b6zmckoudmi@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="ur internet mom ash" href=#>ur internet mom ash</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljine2pr00b83b6z6mhhuek0@published data-word-count=15><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 698,000<br><strong>Most-popular recap:</strong> “<a href=#>Alright, Let’s See What the Hype Is All About</a>”<br><strong>Views:</strong> 2.7 million<br><strong>Length:</strong> 18:47</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljinetxi00dl3b6z4f197p21@published data-word-count=68>➼ Like Mike’s Mic does, Ashley elevates reaction vids with a funny, fast editing style that makes even her longest videos feel like they’re speeding by.

Nikki and Steven got big posting episode-by-episode reaction videos to<strong> </strong>The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones during its final season, and have applied the formula to other sort of widely viewed, blockbuster series like The Last of Us and Stranger Things.

Matthews is quick on his feet and very easily flabbergasted, which turns out to be a winning combination of traits for a reaction-video guy to have. In many ways, these are the ultimate recaps: such a sweeping overview that you only get the bookends. You’d be amazed at how you can get the gist of a show this way.

It’s a double whammy, a way of promoting its new content while carving out an audience on YouTube. It was lucky to book Trixie and Katya, two popular Drag Race alums who had proved themselves as YouTube auteurs with their (still ongoing) World of Wonder comedy web-series, UNHhhh, in which they shot the shit over topics like “Body Parts” and “Crying” as bizarre, low-budget graphics play around them.

With a sense of humor that veers a little hard into “lolcatz random” millennial internet territory, Meyers produces 15-minute hits that span years as he follows series like Riverdale and the CW’s DC superhero shows through their entire runs. Sometimes he breaks out into song.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljinejpn00bg3b6zvymdnqep@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Emergency Awesome" href=#>Emergency Awesome</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljinejpn00bh3b6zrkqv1nl7@published data-word-count=20><strong>Subscribers: </strong>4.45 million<br><strong>Most-popular recap:</strong> “<a href=#>Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 3 Top 10 WTF and Easter Eggs</a>”<br><strong>Views: </strong>4.9 million<br><strong>Length:</strong> 15:43</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljingqcw00eq3b6z9tfqjf0u@published data-word-count=61>➼ Creator Charles Schneider brings depths of nerd lore and context to his recaps for all of the Marvel, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones series and breaks down trailers for upcoming entries in those franchises.

He brings that same rageful verve to his pop-culture analysis in his nearly two-hour opus “Sherlock Is Garbage, and Here’s Why” from 2017. His analysis is brilliant for the way it breaks down the nature of how episodic entertainment should function and how Steven Moffat jerks viewers around by not meeting those basic tenets.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljingsnv00et3b6zcg02ea6f@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Jenny Nicholson" href=#>Jenny Nicholson</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljingsnv00eu3b6z954h4eyt@published data-word-count=11><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 1.04 million<br><strong>Most-popular recap:</strong> “<a href=#>The Vampire Diaries Video</a>”<br><strong>Views:</strong> 11 million<br><strong>Length:</strong> 2:33:19</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljinhi2600fq3b6ztvb0x7yc@published data-word-count=114>➼ Theme-park vlogger, Star Wars scholar, and My Little Pony collector Jenny Nicholson released her then-longest video in January 2021: a two-and-a-half-hour recap called “THE Vampire Diaries Video.” This media analysis is broken into 26 distinct parts (28 with intro and conclusion) and features Nicholson’s signature wry commentary: When she mocks plot holes or calls out missed opportunities and weak story lines, it comes from a genuine nerdy place of her wanting her trash TV to be the best trash TV it can be. She doesn’t focus exclusively on television, but her Vampire Diaries video established the TV-series deep-dive style as we know it (Mike’s Mic’s Pretty Little Liars series came later that year).</p><p class=subscriber-copy>Thank you for subscribing and supporting our journalism<span id=givenName></span>.
