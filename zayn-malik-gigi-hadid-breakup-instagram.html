The quote should have been the first sign of trouble—and perhaps the sexy thirst-trap image should've signified Malik's new status a single man.

"She has such an incredible soul. I'm grateful to all of our fans for respecting this difficult decision and our privacy at this time, we wish this news could have come from us first."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hadid shared an equally emotional tweet saying, "Breakup statements often seem impersonal because there is really no way to put into words what two people experience together over a few years .. not only in the relationship, but in life in general. I'm forever grateful for the love, time, and life lessons that Z and I shared."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Malik and Hadid first started dating in early 2015.
