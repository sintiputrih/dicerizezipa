With over eight years of producing content, she has mastered the art of juggling both studies and YouTube.</p><p>She titled her channel ‘Ruby Granger’ after the Harry Potter character Hermione Granger. She posts a range of films on topics such as study suggestions, motivation, advice, and productivity. In reality, she occasionally uploads vlogs. She barely had a little over 2,000 subscribers in her first two years of filming videos. Regardless, she kept posting videos without being discouraged by fewer views. The following year, she achieves her first breakthrough when a video titled “Study with Me || 14 Hour Study Day” goes viral and becomes her most-viewed video on the channel.</p><p>Following that, she posted another similar video titled “Study With Me || 15-HOUR STUDY DAY (study motivation)” which received a couple of million views.
