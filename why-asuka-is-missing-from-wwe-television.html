According to the <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter, </a>Asuka is doing fine and that she simply isn’t being used right now because, despite showing up to RAW’s television tapings, creative has nothing for her.</p><p>“For those asking about Asuka, she is fine. She’s just not being used for anything right now. She was at the Raw tapings early but left early since she wasn’t being used.”</p><p>We certainly hope Asuka will be able to make her return to WWE television as soon as possible as her inclusion is definitely needed on Monday Night RAW. She doesn’t appear to be injured, so fans might see Asuka find herself back on television after WWE gets over SummerSlam season.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
