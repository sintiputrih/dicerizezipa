He was a novelist, writer of short stories and essays, playwright, screenwriter and poet, and was active in the industry from 1938 to 2012. Ray passed away in 2012.</p><p>How much was the net worth of Ray Bradbury? It had been reported by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth was equal to $30 million, converted to the present day. Writing was the major source of Bradbury’s fortune.</p><h3>Ray Bradbury Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the boy grew up in the time of Great Depression. After the family finally settled in Los Angeles, Bradbury attended Los Angeles High School, and subsequently graduated from UCLA in 1938, after which for a while sold newspapers for living.</p><p>From an early age, Ray had always been an avid reader, writer, and cartoonist for his own amusement. He was first published in the late ‘30s – his eyesight was so poor he was rejected for military servicm so wrote instead, notably for “Fanzines” and “Script” during the ‘40s. His reputation as a writer was established with the publication of “The Martian Chronicles” (1950), then “Fahrenheit 451” (1953) was released, which many considered Bradbury’s masterpiece. Other works of the writer include “The October Country” (1955), “Something Wicked This Way Comes” (1962), “I Sing the Body Electric!” (1969), among many others. Bradbury’s works are usually short stories, and their centre is not action, but dialogue, monologue, reflection. The writer combines fantasy with detection and melodrama. His works do not have comprehensive descriptions of technological details, but much attention is paid to the place of action, the appearance of heroes, names, dates and figures. Thoughts are thoroughly built, but they are not the main part of his works. Bradbury’s emotions, atmosphere, and feeling are more important than action. In his works, Bradbury laughs from people without imagination. Evil and violence in his work are unrealistic, and it’s best to ignore them without paying attention to them. According to Bradbury himself, he wrote over 400 stories throughout his life. Some of them later became larger works, others belong to specific cycles. His short stories appeared in over a thousand of anthologies of recommended reading in schools.</p><p>Ray Bradbury’s work has been inducted into collections of four Best American Short Story. He was rewarded among others with the O. Henry Memorial Award, the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America, Award PEN centre USA West Lifetime Achievement. The stand-out was his Pulitzer Prize in 2007.</p><p>Bradbury never confined his vision to pure literature. For his animated film “Icarus Montgolfier Wright” he was nominated for an Academy Award, and won an Emmy Award for his screenplay for television “The Halloween Tree”. He adapted 65 of his stories for Ray Bradbury Theatre of television.</p><p>Additionally, Bradbury was the creative consultant on the US Pavilion at the New York World’s Fair of 1964. In 1982, he created the interior metaphors sample Spaceship Earth at Epcot Centre, Disney World and later contributed to the conception of spatial route in Disneyland Paris, France.</p><p>The Ray Bradbury Award is presented by the group of sci-fi writers Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to highlight the excellence of a dramatic work presented in cinema, television, internet, radio or at the theatre.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of Ray Bradbury, he was married to Maggie Bradbury from 1947, and they lived in Los Angeles until Maggie died in 2003; they had four daughters. Ray died on the 5th June 2012 in Los Angeles, California – at his request, his tombstone at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery bears the epitaph: Author of Fahrenheit 451.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=28.044676098287><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Ray Bradbury</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 22, 1920, Waukegan, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>June 5, 2012, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Writer, Producer, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Los Angeles High School, UCLA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Maggie Bradbury (m. 1947-2003, her death)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Bettina F.

The responsibility of Hollywood is to prove that we are human. Not with happy endings, but with moments we take away and remember.</td></tr><tr readability=27><td>2</td><td>If you were to ask me what I think of Hollywood today, it's more of the same, except worse. I grew up in Hollywood, I roller skated around here, and got autographs and photographs when I was 14 years old, so I know the community very well. But things have gotten worse, because we're making more money today out of doing lousy films. A good example is The Mummy, it came out when I was 12 years old, I loved the film with Boris Karloff, a very minor film with a minor amount of money, probably cost $100,000 or less. But it's a beautiful film, with a nice script. They made a new version here at Universal 5 years ago, it was a terrible film. They thought "If one mummy's scares you, 2 dozen mummies, a chorus line of mummies has got to be very scary." So the film came out, dreadful film, and it made $500 million. So they were encouraged into believing that doing lousy films is profitable; but even worse than the old days. So they did another film called The Mummy Returns, and it was even worse than the first one, and it made a billion dollars, so they were encouraged in going ahead to making lousy films instead of quality films. So things haven't changed, they've just gotten bigger, and lousier.</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>3</td><td>After 9/11, Hollywood promised they were going to make more family films, less violence, and things of that sort, well it's never happened. Films have gotten more violent. The Bond films are unwatchable now; I was around 45 years ago when the Bond films began. They were nice quiet little films, every 5 minutes a little bit of action perhaps. But now there's an explosion every 5 minutes and they set off 10 billion gallons of gasoline, and there are more macho selves being made today, in which people settle things with guns, and with machine guns. So things have not improved. They've gotten worse.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Without libraries what have we?

All the great stories of the world are metaphorical, so they can be remembered. That's why so much stage writing and film writing today can't be remembered, because there are no metaphors. You can't tell the story when you come out of the theater. That's what's wrong with most modern fiction. Realism is what we already know. My job is to interpret realism, to turn it into metaphors, so you can swallow it.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>13</td><td>There are two races of people - men and women - no matter what what women's libbers would have you pretend.
