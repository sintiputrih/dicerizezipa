These popular pitaya bowls are not just beautiful to look at, but they are absolutely delicious! Filled with antioxidants, Vitamin C, and fiber, they provide natural energy and micronutrients that help the body function at its very best.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s the difference between a smoothie and a smoothie bowl?</h2><p>Basically, the only difference is that a bowl uses less liquid so it’s firmer and can be eaten with a spoon. The best part is that you can top it off with all sorts of toppings from fresh fruit to coconut flakes to nuts to chia seeds. The sky is the limit! There’s something about actually chewing your food that keeps you satisfied longer. It feels like a treat because it tastes so good without any added sugars.</p><p>If you love pitaya bowls, make sure to check out my other easy <a href=#>smoothie bowl</a> recipes!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pitaya-Bowl-3-scaled.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What goes in a pitaya bowl?</h2><p>The beauty of these tropical pitaya bowls is the flexibility. I am sharing my favorite recipe, what I have found that works the best. But if you prefer any variation, it is a simple substitution!</p><ul><li><strong>Pitaya</strong>: Also known as dragon fruit, this bright pink fruit is what gives the bowl its color and sweet flavor. The fruit is so sweet on its own that the packets do not have any added sugars. It’s full of antioxidants, which neutralize free radicals that are detrimental to our bodies. Plus they are packed with fiber, an important aid in digestion.</li><li><strong>Pineapple chunks</strong>: These work best when frozen. Pineapple adds a sweet and tangy flavor that compliments the pitaya well. Its tropical flavor is characteristic of this smoothie bowl.</li><li><strong>Mango chunks</strong>: These, too, are best frozen. Sweet mango has the perfect flavor to add to the other tropical fruits in this smoothie bowl.</li><li><strong>Banana</strong>: Frozen banana is integral in getting a creamy smoothie bowl. It adds even more sweetness to the bowl while perfecting the texture.</li><li><strong>Coconut water</strong>: Although smoothie bowls are thick, they still need a little bit of liquid in order to have the creamy, smooth, and almost ice cream like texture that we are going for. Coconut water is fresh and has the perfect flavor!</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pitaya-Dragonfruit-Smoothie-Bowl.-10-e1709570535137.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where do you buy pitaya?</h3><p>They are in the frozen section of grocery stores. Check out Sprouts, Whole Foods, and even Smart & Final. They are gaining in popularity so check out your local grocery store to see if they have begun stocking these beauties.</p><p>I have also seen bags of frozen dragon fruit chunks start to be sold in my local grocery stores such as Target and Costco!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pitaya-Bowl-1-scaled.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Smoothie bowl toppings:</h2><p>Since a smoothie bowl is thick enough to eat with a spoon, it’s delicious to eat with a variety of toppings that add texture and heartiness to the bowl. Here are some of my favorites!</p><ul><li>Fresh Fruit: Raspberries, kiwi, banana, strawberries, blueberries</li><li><a href=#>Homemade granola</a></li><li>Raw nuts: Think sliced almonds, cashews, walnuts, or anything similar</li><li>Coconut flakes: Either sweetened or unsweetened coconut flakes really rounds out the tropical flavors of the smoothie bowl!</li><li>Cacao nibs: Bitter cacao nibs bring a delicious crunch to the bowl.</li><li>Goji berries</li><li>Pumpkin seeds</li><li>Bee pollen</li><li>Chia seeds, hemp seeds, or flax seeds</li><li>Honey</li><li>Nut butters such as peanut butter or almond butter can help add some more healthy fats and proteins to your smoothie bowl, as well as adding some saltiness and heartiness!</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC_0272ed3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pitaya bowl variations</h2><p>The beauty of smoothie bowls is that you get to make them how you like! Add your favorite fruits, take out the ones you don’t like as much. Make sure to do what you like most and don’t be afraid to experiment!</p><ul><li><strong>You can substitute the frozen mango or pineapple</strong> for another fruit, if you want a less tropical flavor profile. I suggest keeping the dragon fruit or pitaya for the color and nutrients it adds. I also suggest keeping the banana because it helps create a smooth, creamy bowl.</li><li><strong>Add in a scoop of protein powder or nut butter </strong>for an extra nutrition boost.</li><li><strong>To make it extra creamy, swap out the almond milk for coconut milk</strong> or cashew milk.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pitaya-Dragonfruit-Smoothie-Bowl-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tips for making the Best Pitaya Smoothie Bowl:</h2><ul><li>The key to a <strong>very thick smoothie bowl is to not add too much liquid</strong>. Don’t be tempted to add more.</li><li><strong>Use frozen fruit</strong> for a thicker and colder smoothie.</li><li><strong>For best results, use a high powered blender</strong> with a sharp blade. My favorite blender to use is <a href=#>Vitamix</a>.</li><li><strong>You can also enjoy this as a smoothie!&nbsp;Just add 1/4 cup more almond milk </strong>and omit the toppings.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC_0078ed2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are dragon fruit bowls healthy?</h2><p>Dragon fruit is full of vitamins, nutrients, and antioxidants that are really good for you! It is high in vitamin C and also can help with iron levels. However, if I want to add more macro nutrients to this snack to turn it into more of a meal, I try to add some more proteins and fats. You can add protein powders, nut butters, or Greek yogurt to help make this healthy smoothie into something a little more substantial!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Recipe_variations>Recipe variations</span></h2><ul><li>You can substitute the frozen mango or pineapple for another fruit, if you want a less tropical flavor profile.
