The feature explodes the dead bodies of enemies to kill more enemies.</p><p>If an enemy is killed violently, its corpse carries the agony it experienced during the final moments. The agony can be focused into a single explosion with the help of a spell.</p><p>The corpse explosion power is not limited to necromancers. Enemy characters like Nihlathak and fire-enchanted monsters also have this power which can seriously harm your character.&nbsp;</p><p>Blizzard employed called the power the “best skill of all time.” It is crucial for fighting against a crowd of enemies. As this skill does not need regeneration, it can be one of the most devasting powers.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply, use one corpse to kill a group of enemies. Then, use the corpses to destroy a larger group, and so on.</p><p>The power causes 50% fire damage and 50% physical damage. Only a few monsters are immune to this attack; however, monsters resistant to physical damage or fire are significantly less affected by this move.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: Rapper Name Ideas For Girls and Boys 2023</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ6Rory2v4ynnJyqn6Kur6%2FEq2SnmZ2awG6yzqtkn52dlrmmecCnm2alkaGybrXNZpuimZKhvG611Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bunny-debarge.html><span>←</span><span>Bunny Debarge Net Worth - Wiki, Age, Weight and Height, Relationships, Family, and More</span></a>
