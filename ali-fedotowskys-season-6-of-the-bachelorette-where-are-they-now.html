There’s no question.’ Well, now here I am, 10 years later, finally admitting I didn’t know. <a href=#>If Frank had stayed, it might have been Frank</a>.”</p><p>The blogger, whose romance with Roberto didn’t last, added that she struggled with being the lead of the reality show.</p><p>“It is so difficult. I hated being the Bachelorette. And that’s the truth,” Ali told Us. “I am beyond grateful. Like, my life would not be what it is today. If I wasn’t on that show, I wouldn’t have the platform I have. I wouldn’t have the amazing community around me. I wouldn’t have met my husband, wouldn’t have my kids, like, I’m so beyond grateful for The Bachelorette. But I hated my experience.”</p><p>Several months later, Ali admitted she was not looking forward to revisiting the show when her season was picked for an August 2020 episode of The Bachelor: The Greatest of All Time.</p><p>“Oh man. I just puked in my mouth a little bit 😂,” she commented on The Bachelor’s official Instagram about the episode. “I’m soooooo nervous to watch this! Ha!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Her husband,<a href=#><strong> Kevin Manno</strong></a>, however, was ready to watch. “@kevinmanno has never seen it but he’s EXCITED to watch,” she wrote. “I’m concerned about his mental health now 😂😂😂.”</p><p>Scroll through for an update from the biggest names from season 6:</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWuap5xZ6bqKyfrMCsxdJmqp6Zo6S7boKMqJ1mrJiaeqOtwqGcpaeimsG1sYywn56qlWKus7GMrZ%2BesV2jvLh7wqGpoqtdoa6urtOopWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./swifties-point-out-sabrina-carpenter-jake-gyllenhaal-snl-connection.html><span>←</span><span>Swifties Point Out Sabrina Carpenter, Jake Gyllenhaal SNL Connection</span></a>
