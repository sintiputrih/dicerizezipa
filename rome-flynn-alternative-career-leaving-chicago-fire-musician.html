I’m so jealous!!!” Another person added: “You're a great actor and even better singer! I am proud of your growth, bruh. Keep pushing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/818adbde88dc-romeflynn.jpg><p id=eG2gzoviMeU data-wc=45>Fans were loving the new single too, with one posting on Instagram: “It’s not enough for him to be beautiful, actor, play basketball, he still sings like an angel.” Another fan added: “Love it when you drop new music AND pop up on our screen!”&nbsp;</p><p id=emFsSL2Qt1L data-wc=64>Speaking to Variety about leaving the show, he explained: “Just like all the fans, I was sad to see Gibson leave. He was a character I very much enjoyed playing… I had a wonderful experience during my time on Chicago Fire and have great respect for the cast and crew and hope to team up with Dick Wolf again when the time is right.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f2496d69f87f-rome-flynn-chicago-fire.jpg><p id=eOP4--wJUBP7 data-wc=72>Speaking about his love of music back in 2020, Rome revealed that Rihanna reached out to congratulate him on his singing, telling HollywoodLife: “It was random because I had never met her or anything. I was at the point where I was in the middle of trying to figure out what I was doing with music and acting. And it had become kind of difficult to maintain both at the same time. &nbsp;</p><p id=eEguZ3TNkdkF data-wc=56>“And I didn’t know what direction I wanted to go, and then I got a DM from [Rihanna] almost right after I was thinking about that situation. She sent one of the videos I had put on my IG. She said that I had a great voice, and I was like, ‘Wow, I appreciate that, Queen.’”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="7 stars who were forced to leave TV shows: From Chicago Fire's Rome Flynn to Castle's Stana Katic & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0c77b335810b-rome-flynn-stana-katic-daniel-dae-kim.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="7 stars who were forced to leave TV shows: From Chicago Fire's Rome Flynn to Castle's Stana Katic & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>7 stars who were forced to leave TV shows: From Chicago Fire's Rome Flynn to Castle's Stana Katic & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Chicago Fire's new star Michael Bradway: From career to famous girlfriend, all to know amid major season 12 cast change" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a5ff4206550f-michael-bradway-chicago-fire-cast.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Chicago Fire's new star Michael Bradway: From career to famous girlfriend, all to know amid major season 12 cast change" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Chicago Fire's new star Michael Bradway: From career to famous girlfriend, all to know amid major season 12 cast change</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=efipmNY9cQgL data-wc=68>He added: “I started doing music before acting came about, but acting just took off on its own, so I kind of put it aside until I had the time and space to revisit it again.

I decided to wait until I was able to have the creative space to do it again.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
