The participants, most of whom had painted their skin blue, piled the objects into a metal drum along with some flash paper, which they lit on fire. They called themselves the <a href=#>Blue Man Group</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16rlzaf00263e6pzkvp5x5u@published data-word-count=129>Within months, the group of Blue Men had been winnowed down to three: Chris Wink, Matt Goldman, and Phil Stanton. Over the next few years, with input from a circle of art-school kids and musicians, they would bring their constantly evolving act to many spots around the city — they played with vaudeville at King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, experimented with flying paint at La MaMa, and eventually landed at Astor Place Theatre. The three characters were general outsiders, unfamiliar with our customs and unable to speak but endlessly curious and eager to connect; they also caught a heroic number of food items in their mouths. “The word on the street was we were nuts,” says Larry Heinemann, who played with the group on instruments including the Chapman Stick.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16rlzck00273e6p4wpi0qdj@published data-word-count=68>There have since been shows in Boston, Chicago (where Fred Armisen was a drummer with the Blue Men early in his career), Las Vegas, Orlando, and beyond, as well as commercial campaigns featuring the original trio and tours with Moby, David Bowie, and Busta Rhymes. This past November, the <a href=#>Astor Place show</a> marked its 30th year — one of the most successful Off Broadway runs of all time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16rlzff00283e6pyvlhpyal@published data-word-count=94>That this undeniably unusual show found an audience when it launched — during the rise of rave culture and a few years after Burning Man debuted on Baker Beach — made a certain kind of sense for the era. But its lasting success has surprised no one more than the founders themselves. “From the beginning, we weren’t just trying to be pure — to make art and gaze at our navels,” says Wink. “But it’s not like we expected to get as far as we did. It would have been insane to think that.”</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl16rp4el004p3e6pe3msnw5l@published><span class=unordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>.</p></span>Going Blue</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16rphbx004y3e6pxd0h0l5d@published data-word-count=49>Wink and Goldman met while attending Fieldston School in the Bronx.

They used velvet ropes to set up a ten-by-ten-foot square on the sidewalk — which they called Club Nowhere — and invited anyone who wanted to party inside for free. “Club Nowhere was the last of the verbal Blue Man events,” Heinemann says. “Around then, we discussed how the character doesn’t talk.” They soon began developing a series of short performance pieces inspired by sources as varied as fractal geometry and the Japanese drumming troupe Kodo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4d6/c0e/0e4562848c68364946760adca3c2aab8db-1994-1996-mirinda-ads.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Astor Place Theatre playbill in 1991.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16rwnul005r3e6pzfr84uyh@published data-word-count=185>In 1991, they staged a production called Tubes at the Off–Off Broadway theater La MaMa. During one segment, the Blue Men wore goo-squirting nozzles (people in the front rows were given protective plastic wrap to wear). Tubes began an open-ended run at Astor Place Theatre in November 1991. The show had more music, new segments, and, for the first time, an arc, which moved from alienation (it started with the Blue Men staring down the audience) to community (the finale involved audience members unfurling rolls of crêpe paper over their heads that left everyone covered in a type of connective tissue). The Blue Men drummed, accompanied by a three-person band; they jumped into the audience to dance; and for every show, they invited someone onstage to eat a Twinkie. They also installed tubes around the theater that traveled from the basement (which served as the backstage space) up to the seating area. Before and during shows, performers and crew members used the tubes to speak to the audience. Transitioning a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants operation to the more formal demands of an Off Broadway production presented some difficulties.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16sliwi00163e6pxmludnpl@published data-word-count=40><strong>Kevin Cunningham, production stage manager, 1991–92:</strong> During rehearsals, the cable snapped for a big flying prop — a box full of heavy laminated cards — and it fell right behind us.

So we got white surgical gloves and had someone dye them. Eventually, somebody called the glove company and said, “Hey, can you dye them for us?” They said, “Yeah.” We couldn’t believe it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16slt86002y3e6pop6827zt@published data-word-count=82><strong>Cunningham:</strong> Each show, they would use about 32 ounces of cream cheese, 80 pounds of Jell-O, two cases of bananas, and 15 gallons of water-based tempera paint. The plywood deck of the stage got permeated with organic matter. One night, I called the first cue and the lights came up but I couldn’t see anybody onstage — there was this sort of black fog. What we were looking at was a blossoming of fruit flies that all hatched at the same time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16slt86002z3e6pid7r4wry@published data-word-count=31><strong>Ian Pai, original drummer:</strong> It took us a long time to learn to be efficient.

The night he stepped in for Stanton transformed what was possible with the show. More than 200 Blue Men have since performed in national and international productions. There are a few requirements: Blue Men must be between five-foot-ten and six-foot-one, skilled at drumming, and able to “wordlessly emote.” (Wink and Goldman, who are just under the height requirement, joke about how they might not be cast if they tried out today.) The training process is a paid eight-week gig, but many candidates are cut before the end. Among other things, they learn to embody six archetypes, which the group calls the “innocent, hero, scientist, shaman, group member, and trickster.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/40d/2b0/ef59e575de5c725ea595080a01cfe26e82-2015-Blue-Man-Group-Paint-Drumming-2.rvertical.w570.jpg> Playing a “drumbone” in 1993.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16sr9it00b23e6pkgdrxunu@published data-word-count=109><strong>Wink:</strong> Each archetype has a binary opposite. The hero is trying to create an effect on the room, and the opposite is the innocent, who is just taking things in. The scientist is for the times the Blue Man is thinking, What is this? The shaman, for lack of a better term, tends to cultural rituals. Then there’s the group member and the trickster. What often happens is the three Blue Men are doing the same thing, then one deviates — that’s the trickster. The archetypes were created to help Blue Men be clear on the inside, even though they’re not making big expressions, on where they’re coming from.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16srakx00b53e6ph9x38q3y@published data-word-count=13><strong>Day:</strong> The audition process was about having to express feelings with your eyes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16sraky00b63e6ptnvtokzg@published data-word-count=35><strong>Mark Frankel, a Blue Man since 2005:</strong> They gave me different scenarios.

It became huge there. The next year, at the 43rd Grammys, the Blue Men performed Moby’s song “Natural Blues” with Moby and Jill Scott. “The first person on his feet screaming was Justin Timberlake,” Moby remembers. In subsequent years, the founders, freed from performing and with a well-funded operation behind them, explored a variety of projects — including the Blue School, a private school partly inspired by Reggio Emilia, which launched in 2006. (It now runs through the eighth grade.) In 2010, Goldman, eager to focus on the school, sold his share in the group to a venture-capital firm. Blue Man Group was then valued at somewhat less than $100 million. Wink and Stanton hired, for the first time, a president, whose background made him unusual at the company: He had a Harvard M.B.A. and had worked at McKinsey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9db/c3a/d0d90bd59042d6b65b457c16f2fc6f8b55-2018-GettyImages-1030043944.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> With Jill Scott and Moby in 2001.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16tmsvh000r3e6l2g643dca@published data-word-count=15><strong>Frankel: </strong>It felt like we had a stepmom moving into the house, changing the furniture.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl16srler00bn3e6px5a7qpu1@published data-word-count=40><strong>Willy Burkhardt, president, 2010–13:</strong> They’d been doing the same thing for 20 years.
