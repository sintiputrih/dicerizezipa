Five years later, the couple separated.</p><p class=p1>“I blamed my mom a lot [for the divorce] because I wanted a family so bad,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a>&nbsp;</i>star recalled during <a href=#>a June 2011 E! Entertainment special about her life</a>. “I wanted to have my mom and dad together. I remember just being angry with my mom. I still feel really bad about that.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “Having me at sixteen <a href=#>had to have been a big responsibility</a>. My mom gave up everything for me and had, like, three jobs. She supported me, sacrificed her life for me.”</p><p class=p1>While the “Bad Liar” songstress has since come to&nbsp;understand how her mom<a href=#> worked tirelessly to support their family of two</a>, Selena initially struggled to cope with the divorce. “She would vent and yell at me,” Teefey — who remarried <a href=#><strong>Brian Teefey</strong></a> in 2006 — recalled during the TV special. “All I could do is just say, ‘I’m sorry, but you’ll understand someday.’”</p><p class=p1>As Selena navigated a career in the acting industry, first landing the role of Gianna on&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Barney & Friends</a>&nbsp;</i>before becoming a <a href=#>household name on the Disney Channel</a>, her mom was her No. 1 cheerleader.</p><p class=p1>“[I remember when] she was 6 or 7. I thought I wanted to be an actor. She went to one of my rehearsals with me and sat through the whole thing, not moving,” Mandy, a former actress herself, said during a March 2017 interview with&nbsp;<i><a href=#>The New York Times</a>.</i>&nbsp;“On the way home, she was quiet, and then she goes, ‘You know, Mom, that might be funnier if you did it this way.’ And I thought,&nbsp;‘Oh, no. She’s going to be an actor.’”</p><p class=p1>She added: “I’m surprised she actually had friends. She used to make the kids in the neighborhood do casting calls and try to direct them.”</p><p class=p1>While the mother-daughter duo remained tight as Selena pursued her Hollywood dreams, things hit a snag when the Rare Beauty founder entered into <a href=#>an on-and-off relationship</a> with <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“There is a lot of uncertainty about him as far as Selena’s family is concerned,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in December 2017</a>, noting Mandy had trust issues when it comes to the “Baby” crooner after the former couple’s rocky history. “[Justin] is really hoping that they give him another chance, but he knows that it is going to take some time.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Spring Breakers&nbsp;</i>star’s romance with the Canada native eventually fizzled for good by 2018, with Bieber moving on with <a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong> </a>(née Baldwin). Selena, for her part, was able to get her relationship with Mandy back on track following the breakup.&nbsp;The mother-daughter pair even founded Wondermind, a multimedia platform <a href=#>designed to offer mental health support</a>, together in April 2022 alongside <strong>Daniella Pierson</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“We hope to be the one-stop shop for <a href=#>all aspects of mental fitness</a>. We have taken an unexpected and innovative chance on the way people can understand and participate in a creative foundation to show anyone that a shift is possible,” Mandy said in a statement at the time. “Far from medical or preachy, we’ve struck a balance between education, media and self-reflection that truly inspires growth.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for Selena’s ups and downs with her mother:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwKa4xKeYZp%2BforK7ecyopGalkaOxunnTnpyfnamoera80maYp5xdmby4utJmmGasmaKyrbXNnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lilie-james.html><span>←</span><span>Polo Coach Lilie James Wiki, Obituary, Age, Parents, Boyfriend and More</span></a>
