He died on 23 April 1616 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. William Shakespeare was a writer, poet, and actor from England. He is largely considered&nbsp;the finest English-language writer and the world's preeminent playwright.&nbsp;He is known as the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard") and England's national poet. His existing works, including collaborations, include 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three big narrative poems, and a few additional verses, the authorship of which is unknown.</p><p>&nbsp;His plays have been translated into every major living language and have had more productions than any other dramatist. During Shakespeare's lifetime, many of his plays were published in versions of variable quality and authenticity. However, in 1623, two of Shakespeare's fellow players and colleagues, John Heminges and Henry Condell, released the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a foresighted poem by Ben Jonson, a former adversary of Shakespeare, in which he praised Shakespeare with the now-famous term "not of an age, but for all time."

The ballad was masterfully delivered by the 88-year-old famous actress. On the show, where she appeared with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jack Whitehall, and Jay Blade, Dench discussed her memoir, saying, "Michael&nbsp;and I were both in Shakespeare plays for four years when we first met, so he literally was paying our rent." When Norton, the talk show presenter, queried the Skyfall actor about Shakespeare's importance in her life, she said, "We don't realize, Graham." We use Shakespeare all the time, possibly unknowingly." When Norton was challenged by Whitehall to identify a literary figure, the audience gasped in surprise when he recalled Hamlet's soliloquy from Act 4, Scene 4: "How all occasions do inform against me." He then challenged Dench, who recited Sonnet 29 from memory.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>Snake Shyam Family</strong></a></p><table border=1 cellspacing=0><tbody readability=2.9><tr><td><p>Real Name</p></td><td><p>William Shakespeare</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Other Name</p></td><td><p>William</p></td></tr><tr readability=4.5><td><p>Profession</p></td><td readability=6><p>English playwright, poet and actor</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Year Birth</p></td><td><p>26 April 1564</p></td></tr><tr readability=4.5><td><p>Birthplace</p></td><td readability=6><p>Stratford-upon-Avon, England</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zodiac</p></td><td><p>Taurus</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Age</p></td><td><p>52 years old</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nationality</p></td><td><p>‎ British</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Religion</p></td><td><p>Not Mentioned</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ethnicity</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Category</p></td><td><p><a href=#><strong>Biography</strong></a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Relationship Status, William Shakespeare Wife /Children</h3><p><img alt="William Shakespeare wife" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1698651614.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><table border=1 cellspacing=0><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td><p>Relationship Status</p></td><td><p>Married</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Wife Name</p></td><td><p>None</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fiancé/Wife Name</p></td><td><p>Anne Hathaway</p></td></tr><tr readability=7.5><td readability=5><p>William Shakespeare Children</p></td><td readability=6><p>Susanna, Judith and Hamnet</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Physical Appearance of William Shakespeare</h3><table border=1 cellspacing=0><tbody><tr><td><p>Height</p></td><td><p>5'7” (1.70 m)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weight</p></td><td><p>187 lb / 85 kg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Eye Color</p></td><td><p>Black</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hair Color</p></td><td><p>Grey</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>William Shakespeare Net Worth/Salary</h3><table border=1 cellspacing=0><tbody readability=1><tr readability=3><td><p>Salary</p></td><td readability=5><p>N/A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Net Worth</p></td><td><p>£1.1 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Last Year Net Worth</p></td><td><p>£1.1 billion.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Profession</p></td><td><p>writer, Poet, and Actor</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>William Shakespeare Education</h3><table border=1 cellspacing=0><tbody><tr><td><p>School</p></td><td><p>High School</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>University/College</p></td><td><p>University of Stratford</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Education</p></td><td><p>Graduate</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Degree</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>Mike Johnson Wife</strong></a></p><h3>William Shakespeare Family</h3><table border=1 cellspacing=0><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td><p>Father</p></td><td><p>Mr. John Shakespeare</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mother</p></td><td><p>Mrs. Mary Shakespeare</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sister</p></td><td><p>Anne Shakespeare</p></td></tr><tr readability=7.5><td><p>Brother</p></td><td readability=8><p>Gilbert, Joan, Richard, and Edmund</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Grand Parents</p></td><td><p>Unknown</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>William Shakespeare Social Media Account</h3><h3>FAQ About William Shakespeare</h3><p><strong>Ques.1 What was William Shakespeare Age?</strong></p><p>Ans.
