Eric Jackson was born on 16th December 1978, and Deongel Holmes on 23rd February 1979 both in Atlanta, Georgia USA.</p><p>So just how rich are the Ying Yang Twins? Sources estimate that the duo has a current net worth of $100,000, although in 2005, the media was writing that they were worth over $25 million; even in 2013, the duo had a net worth of $10 million. The two artists have been making most of their money in the music industry, writing several hits, and performing in concerts and shows.</p><h3>Ying Yang Twins Net Worth $100,000</h3><p>The hip-hop duo formed in 2000 in Atlanta, launching their first hit “Whistle While You Twurk”. However, the artists became better known three years later, when they released the hip-hop hit “Get Low”. This success has been followed by a series of hit singles, including “What’s Happnin”, “Shake”, “Badd”, “Ying Yang in This Thang” and “Salt Shaker”. The best-known song performed by the Ying Yang Twins, “Halftime”, was released in 2010 in collaboration with Homebwoi – this became a hit mostly because it is played often in New Orleans, after the Saints’ football touchdowns.</p><p>The hip-hop artists have released seven studio albums, two remix albums, three compilations and they appear on four mixtapes. Some of their most appreciated albums are “Alley: The Return of the Ying Yang Twins”, from 2002, “U.S.A. (United State of Atlanta)”, from 2005, and “Chemically Imbalanced”, from 2006, the last two being considered the highest point in the duo’s history. A success was also their third album, “Me & My Brother”, which was released in 2003. This went platinum, bringing the artists over $1 million from album sales alone. The Ying Yang Twins have also worked with numerous important artists of the genre, such as Tone Bone, JusRythm, and Kid Money. They also made an appearance as themselves in the comedy “Soul Plane”, by Jessy Terrero, in 2004.</p><p>After 2006, the duo lost some of their popularity, this being the time when their net worth started decreasing. If during the mid-2000s the artists were making about $20,000 a month each, in 2013 media reported that <a href=#>D-Roc</a> was dealing with financial difficulties, as his monthly income had been under $3,000 for several months.</p><p>So the down sid is that in recent years, the Ying Yang Twins achieved some notoriety in the media, after the Police arrested <a href=#>D-Roc</a> in 2012 for driving under the influence, and in 2014 for assaulting his wife. The duo have been writing music, releasing albums and touring in these years, but their success is much lower than it was at the beginning of their career. In 2012, they signed a contract with Epic Records.</p><p><a href=#>D-Roc</a> has been married twice. He has one daughter from his first marriage and another two children with his second wife, Porsche. <a href=#>Kaine</a> keeps his private life away from the spot light. The hip-hop artists are trying to promote their music through social media, having 31,000 followers on Twitter, about 5,000 friends on Instagram, and 369,000 fans on Facebook.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.4556962025316><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Ying Yang Twins</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Hip hop duo</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Ying Yang Twinz</td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/yingyangtwins</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4390243902439><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/lilpump</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/yingyangtwins</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2075163</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Record Labels</td><td>TVT Records, Epic Records, Universal Records, Deep Records</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Nominations</td><td>BET Award for Viewer's Choice, MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video, Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, MTV Video Music Award for Ringtone of the Year, Soul Train Music Award for Best Video of the Year, American Music Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Band/Duo/Group, Billboard...</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=25.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>Office Christmas Party</td><td>2016</td><td>performer: "Deck Da Club", "Booty Bounce Pop" / writer: "Deck Da Club"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk</td><td>2016</td><td>performer: "Salt Shaker"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Pitch Perfect 2</td><td>2015</td><td>performer: "Fist Pump, Jump Jump"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Rap Critic Reviews</td><td>2014-2015</td><td>TV Series performer -
