No. Actually, far from it. But that’s precisely what makes Bey and Jay such an incredible couple. In addition to the good stuff — showing up for each other, taking the stage together and more — they’ve weathered a few harrowing storms in their relationship and come out on the other side. Remember that infamous Met Gala debacle involving Bey’s sister Solange? How about the couple’s candid confessions in recent years regarding Jay’s alleged infidelity?
