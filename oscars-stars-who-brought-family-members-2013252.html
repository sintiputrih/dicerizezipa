She said, ‘Hi Woody, nice to see you. I’m Jonah Hill’s mom.’”</p><p>As for Leto, the Thirty Seconds to Mars frontman’s 2014 Oscar dates were his mom, <strong>Constance Leto</strong>, and older brother<strong> Shannon Leto</strong>. The singer gave his mother a sweet shoutout while accepting his Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work in Dallas Buyers Club at the time.</p><p>“In 1971, Bossier City, Louisiana, there was a teenage girl who was pregnant with her second child,” the Suicide Squad star said onstage. “She was a high school dropout and a single mom, but somehow she managed to make a better life for herself and her children. She encouraged her kids to be creative, to work hard and to do something special. That girl is my mother and she’s here tonight. And I just want to say, I love you, Mom. Thank you for teaching me to dream.”</p><p>Eight years later, the Louisiana native revealed that his trophy was missing. “You know, I found out that it’s been missing for, like three years, and I didn’t know that,” Jared told <a href=#><strong>James Corden</strong></a> in January 2021. “I don’t think anyone wanted to tell me. It could be somewhere, but everyone’s searched for it high and low. I hope it’s in good hands wherever it is. We haven’t seen it for quite some time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Noting that an Oscar isn’t “something someone accidentally throws in the trash,” the Fight Club star added, “I remember the night I got it, I passed it around to so many people. It was beat up and scratched up, but people had fun taking pictures with it. It’s nice to share it so hopefully, someone is taking good care of it.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see<a href=#><strong> Tom Hanks</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></a> and more stars attending the Academy Awards with their family members over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BkwKSt0axkrKyRp8Buw8eoZJuqn6q0qcCMn5imoZyueq6xzJucq6tdZ31yf5FuaWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jan-kosi.html><span>←</span><span>Jan Kosi</span></a>
