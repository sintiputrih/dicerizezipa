With just a few episodes left, some fans were worried that Georgie and Mandy’s storyline would be left unfinished. That certainly won’t be a problem.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily Osment</a>, the actor who portrays Mandy McAllister, will appear in season 6 as a series regular instead of a recurring character, according to a new report.&nbsp;</p><h2>Emily Osment has been promoted to a series regular on ‘Young Sheldon’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-2_33>Mandy and Georgie’s lives will be intertwined indefinitely, and&nbsp;Young Sheldon&nbsp;writers plan to explore that storyline more in season 6. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, Osment will be returning for season 6 of&nbsp;Young Sheldon&nbsp;as a series regular.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Emily-Osment.jpg><p id=par-3_67>Her character, Mandy, was introduced in “A Lock-In, a Weather Girl and a Disgusting Habit,” the 11th episode of season 5. She has appeared in six episodes so far. Her pregnancy arc is far from complete and is unlikely to be resolved by the time&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season 5&nbsp;</a>ends on May 19. Whether season 6 will open with Osment pregnant or if she’ll have already given birth is anyone’s guess.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_48>In theory, the show’s writers could stretch out Mandy and Georgie’s storyline over multiple seasons. In March 2021, CBS ordered three additional seasons of the show. Season 5 is currently airing, and season 6 and season 7 are planned. The order should bring fans through Sheldon’s 14th year.&nbsp;</p><h2>Several important plot points are coming up in season 6 and season 7 of ‘Young Sheldon’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-5_61>Much of what will happen in seasons 6 and 7 remains a mystery, but we can guess some major plot points. In&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory,&nbsp;Sheldon Cooper revealed that he walked in on his father having an affair when he was 13. He used his father’s affair to explain&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his odd knocking ritua</a>l. Sheldon also confirmed that his father died the following year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Young-Sheldon-6.jpg><p id=par-6_65>In season 5 of&nbsp;Young Sheldon, Sheldon and his twin, Missy, are 12 years old. If the upcoming seasons follow the same general time progression, the twins will be 13 in season 6; the year Sheldon caught his father with another woman. Season 7 is likely the season where George will die if&nbsp;Young Sheldon&nbsp;follows the timeline set in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Big Bang Theory</a>. Nothing is exactly guaranteed, though.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-steve-molaro-said-the-series-is-only-loosely-following-the-big-bang-theory>Steve Molaro said the series is only loosely following&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_40>Since the start of&nbsp;Young Sheldon, fans have noticed the prequel has created&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a few significant plot holes</a>. It’s likely that the show’s writers will create more as the show progresses. Co-creator, Steve Molaro, said there is some leeway with the timeline.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_73>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Line</a>, Molaro said, “It’s not like Adult Sheldon has decided to sit down and tell us one story a week that happened&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;30 years ago.” He explained, “We can slow things down when we need to, but also honor some sort of realistic timeline.” Could the team slow things down to give George more time or stretch out Mandy’s pregnancy? It’s possible. We’ll have to wait to see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTGsMHNoGSsoJWhsbC6jJ%2BYp6tdrLatuIybnGarlZq2r7OMmmSlp6RiurC%2BxGamn2WdlrulxYyipWarlZbAsLqMb2WhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-tv-show-accused-about.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Accused About?
