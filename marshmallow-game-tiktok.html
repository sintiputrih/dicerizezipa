The game requires two people to play. Both players hit a constant beat and tempo on a flat surface while repeating in tempo, "One marshmallow, check it out, wooh, two marshmallows, two marshmallows, check it out, check it out, wooh, wooh, three marshmallows, three marshmallows, three marshmallows..." and so on.</p><p>How to play is seemingly simple, but it's actually quite challenging. Person A will say, "One marshmallow," Person B will say, "Check it out," it then goes back to Person A for the "wooh," continuing to go back and forth with Person B saying, "Two marshmallows," etc.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@marianne_infante href=#>@marianne_infante</a><p>Probably the longest reel I‚Äôve ever made.

Edit: We didn‚Äôt realise we would start a trend by playing fun drama games üòÇ</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Marianne Infante" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Marianne Infante</a></figure><p>As you can see from the TikTok, posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@marianne_infante</a>, the game gets tricky because the number of marshmallows that are said is also the number of "check it outs" and "woohs" so you have to keep count as you are playing. If you are on "four marshmallows" you repeat that same phrase a total of four times before moving on to the "check it outs" and "woohs" also for four times each.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the video above, Marianne's friend, Tatum, says an extra "four marshmallows" accidentally. Marianne goes, "That was five," to which Tatum replies, "Was it actually?" before both ladies crack up proving that it's very easy to get off track.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And if you don't understanding the rules, that's OK because it's a bit confusing. Clearly, Leanne, one-half the <a href=#>mother and son</a> TikTok content creators <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@grumpyleanneandmaitland,</a> feels the same way.</p><p>In the hilarious TikTok that the pair posted, Leanne tries to play the marshmallow game with her son but doesn't know the rules. Both are clearly frustrated. Leanne says multiple times that she doesn't understand. The commenters agreed that he needed to explain it to her, and another commented saying that this was the most "chaotic" version they had seen.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Some people are really able to nail it the marshmallow game. The video posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@soap.lee</a> proves just that. Sophia and her friend did eight whole rounds of the marshmallow game at the super speed of 54 seconds. You can tell that both ladies were hyper-focused and had their game face on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Another great version of the marshmallow game was posted by <a href=#>father and son</a> content creators <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@mmmjoemele</a> earning 9.2 million views and counting. Joe and his dad, Frank, got to "seven marshmallows" before Joe called it a day captioning that, "This took so long."</p><p>One commenter asked, "How many times did this take" and Joe responded, "Too many... bloopers coming soon." We can't wait to see those bloopers, Joe.</p><p>Have you tried the marshmallow game?
