Over the course of two-and-a-half weeks, Amelia Rose traveled 28,000 miles in one specially fitted 200-gallon fuel tank and only stopped 17 times.

The First Lady of Denver – Mary Louise Lee – will present the Mayor’s Proclamation to Amelia, as she has written a chapter for herself in Colorado’s History Book, and indeed, set a place for herself among Notable Women of the World. Award-winning paper fashions and 1,400 paper airplanes will surround this reception, all created by Barry Brown and assisted by children from Denver Children’s Home.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amelia-rose-earhart-and-amelia-earhart></span><span>Amelia Rose Earhart and Amelia Earhart</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Late Amelia Mary Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932. But when she attempted a flight around the globe with navigator Fred in 1937, she vanished over the South Pacific and was never recovered.
