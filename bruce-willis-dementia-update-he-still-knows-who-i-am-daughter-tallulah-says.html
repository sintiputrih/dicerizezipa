While Bruce’s dementia hasn’t affected his mobility, Tallulah said in a Vogue article published Wednesday, he often frequents the “open plan of the kitchen-dining-living room, or in his office” — the latter which she claimed “is filled with the knickknacks he has collected: vintage toy cars, coins, rocks, objects made of brass."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That’s because I have hopes for my father that I’m so reluctant to let go of.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Tallulah recalled how hurtful comments made online about her “ugly” appearance impacted her self-worth.</p><p>“‘Wow, she looks deformed. Look at her man jaw — she’s like an ugly version of her dad. Her mother must be so disappointed,'” she remembered commenters critiquing a photo of her teenage self while “standing beside my famously beautiful mom.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rumer Willis (from left), Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Tallulah Belle Willis attend the after party for the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis at NeueHouse on July 14, 2018, in Los Angeles. <span class=credit>Getty Images For Comedy Central</span></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The comments about Tallulah <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not looking like her mother</a> bothered her for many years — a feeling she also felt when Bruce’s health started to decline.</p><p>She claimed she knew something was “wrong” with Bruce for a “long time” before<a href=#> his initial aphasia diagnosis</a>.</p><p>“It started out with a kind of vague unresponsiveness, which the family chalked up to Hollywood hearing loss: ‘Speak up!&nbsp;‘Die Hard’&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">messed with Dad’s ears,</a>‘” she recalled.</p><p>“Later that unresponsiveness broadened, and I sometimes took it personally.
