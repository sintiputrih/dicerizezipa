OG Brylan Kerr),&nbsp;Been Thuggin’, No Pressure, RoadRunner (ft. OG Junior), Let’s Get It (ft. Johnny Cinco), and&nbsp;Human Nature.</li><li>OG Maco was in a near-fatal car crash on July 28, 2016, and suffered multiple skull fractures, cracked vertebrae, a broken orbital, heart palpitations, and almost lost his right eye. Although it was claimed that he lost his right eye, the reality was that his eyesight only became extremely distorted and he had to wear an eye patch during his subsequent recovery.</li><li>It was also incorrectly reported that doctors replaced OG Maco’s apparent blinded eye with a prosthetic one. Instead, some surgical procedures were performed on OG Maco’s right eye and they corrected the eyesight as well as eventually made him able to see through it.</li><li>He was diagnosed with a flesh-eating disease known as necrotizing fasciitis, a bacterial infection, which left the rapper’s face disfigured. He then started taking antibiotics for treatment.</li><li>OG Maco’s extended play titled Blvk Phil Collins&nbsp;(stylized as&nbsp;BLVKPHILCOLLINS) was released on September 20, 2016, via OGG and it consists of songs like&nbsp;Talk Too Much,&nbsp;Move, Prayer Line (ft. Theo Ferragamo),&nbsp;What’s a Wallet?, and RAGE!!.</li><p>Featured Image by Asapccampana / <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Wikimedia</a> / CC BY-SA 4.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqieZqWRmLxw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ms-marvel-star-iman-vellani-admits-to-using-fake-accounts-on-marvel-subreddits.html><span>←</span><span>Ms. Marvel star Iman Vellani admits to using fake accounts on Marvel subreddits</span></a>
