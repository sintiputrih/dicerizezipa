Furthermore, he is also a fan of mixed martial arts, as he has been spotted at Karate Combat promotion events and videos many times in the past. Moreover, in a recent social media post shared by fellow fitness icon <strong>Logan Chitwood</strong>, he shared an artwork following their face-off over a month ago.</p><p>Mike O’Hearn is 54 years old and is a 4-time Power Lifting champion. Moreover, he is an accomplished athlete with experience in natural bodybuilding, strongman, powerlifting, and martial arts. Logan Chitwood is an internet personality known for his unique physique and YouTube videos. He recently shared an artwork, teasing a fight against O’Hearn.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Logan Chitwood shares a Karate Combat artwork of him and Mike O’Hearn</h2><p>Over a month ago, ‘The Ogre’ Chitwood and ‘The Titan’ O’Hearn found participated in a weigh-in at Karate Combat amidst the presence of former UFC champion and Hall of Famer <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Georges St-Pierre</strong></a>. The mediator of the weigh-in claimed that the fight between O’Hearn and Chitwood will take place for the Karate Combat Fantasy Character division. Moreover, they even showcased a title for the division.</p><p>Meanwhile, Logan Chitwood went on to share the artwork of a fight between him and O’Hearn in Karate Combat. It was made by an Instagram user by the name<strong> ‘Yokamire’</strong> which drew a response from the former 4-time Power Lifting champion. O’Hearn commented on the post and wrote,&nbsp;“I have this painting up in the office now [Logan Chitwood]”. He claims to have the artwork in his office. While people are skeptical about the fight taking place, O’Hearn showed that he’s tough <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>to a rising UFC star</a>.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>‘The Titan’ once ate a kick from Ian Garry</h2><p>UFC’s Ian Machado Garry, who people claim to be Ireland’s next big MMA star, had a brief interaction with Mike O’Hearn at Karate Combat. At a promotional event, the former powerlifting champion was on the receiving end of a body kick delivered by Ian Garry. It is not uncommon for fitness influencers to attempt kicks or punches from other fighters. Many bodybuilders have attempted to take body shots.</p><p>The welterweight fighter warmed up to throw a right leg kick and made contact with O’Hearn’s body. Nonetheless, this did not seem to have an effect on the bodybuilding icon. O’Hearn, who had very limited martial arts knowledge, defended himself well at 54 years of age against Garry’s kick.</p><p>It is highly unlikely that a fight may take place between Chitwood and O’Hearn. However, if it does take place, fans may take an interest in watching two big men go head-to-head. The current generation is not a stranger to crossover or influencer fights. We will have to wait and see what happens.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>“Most Beautiful 54-Year-Old Man”: Bodybuilding World Comes to Rescue Mike O’Hearn as Jay Cutler Hilariously Denies Using His Method to Stay Fit at 50</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SfmmalnZZ6o7vDspmuoZyZtq%2BzjKecsKtdlrqqsIygnKiql5rAbr%2FTZqeinaKnsrR5z6ucrJ2emLJurs6dsJutmaGxqrrGZqOen5WjsW65yKScZqeYmq6zuoygpp6rXZ2yorCMqK2eql2dsqa40madqKpdm7aotNNmmKusXay2tbSMpaagmZ5isKm107CmqJxdlsFut8CrmK2dXZi8rq7ArWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-anne-heche-first-partner-ellen-degeneres.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Anne Heche first partner Ellen DeGeneres?</span></a>
