Nevertheless, give it a shot by clicking the “cog” icon next to the “Play” button under <strong>Vanguard</strong> and select the “Scan and Repair” option. Maybe you’ll get lucky.</p><p>However, it seems like you might have more luck fixing this issue if you simply restart your computer, reinstall the Battle.net launcher, or update your GPU driver. I’ve also heard some theorize that this could be caused by running additional apps in the background while playing <strong>Vanguard</strong>, so try shutting down pretty everything but <strong>Vanguard</strong> if you’re desperate for a fix.</p><h2 id=h-call-of-duty-vanguard-keeps-freezing-on-ps4>Call of Duty: Vanguard Keeps Freezing on PS4</h2><p>If you’re one of the many PS4 gamers just waiting to get their hands on a PS5, you may be disheartened to learn that <strong>Vanguard</strong> seems to have quite a few compatibility issues with Sony’s best-selling console. Most notably, numerous players are reporting that the PS4 version of the game keeps freezing randomly.</p><p>While you can try resetting your PS4 (or even reinstalling the game) to try to address this issue, it seems that some players have had more luck going into the game’s options menu and disabling “On-demand Texture Streaming” (which you can find under the “Graphics” tab).</p><p>It’s not entirely clear if this is exactly what’s causing this issue, but since it does seem that some of the PS4’s issues are related to optimization problems, it’s certainly worth giving this a shot.</p><h2 id=h-call-of-duty-vanguard-s-many-audio-issues>Call of Duty: Vanguard’s Many Audio Issues</h2><p>Generally speaking, <strong>Call of Duty: Vanguard</strong> has a lot of audio problems. While the most common audio issue with the game seems to be related to its “muffled” audio cues that make it very difficult to hear certain actions, it just seems like there’s generally something wrong with many of the game’s audio files.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOnJilpF2ks26w1K2wZq6Ro7S2rdGdZKGnp2LBsHnFoq9mrJiaeq670q1knKedoryvecGunqxlkaOxbrPLoqucoJWofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./biggest-actor-movie-transformations.html><span>←</span><span>35 Craziest Transformations Actors Made for Movie Roles</span></a>
