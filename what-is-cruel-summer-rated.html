While shows like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Riverdale</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Euphoria</a> may masquerade as teen appropriate dramas, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cruel Summer </a></strong>i<strong>s</strong> definitely one you can throw on when there are teens around. The show is rated TV-14 in the U.S., likely due to the dark premise the entire mystery rests on. The series tackles heavy topics beautifully —season one focuses on grooming — and never indulges in the trauma while it explores the idea that there are two sides to every story.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=741 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Cruel Summer presents its material in incredibly nuanced ways. Taking place in the ‘90s, the series revolves around budding high schoolers and the multitude of social morays and problems that young adults face no matter the decade. Despite its heavy subject matter, Cruel Summer never relies on the nitty gritty to pursue an engaging story. Adults and older teens will doubtless pick up on the subtle implications Cruel Summer employs to address the darker aspects of child grooming, but it’s discreet enough that younger kids will have to ask a few questions to understand the gravity of the situation. With such an important topic, it’s easy to see why the showrunners wanted to leave space for parents to continue the conversations.</p><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>The series may dramatize some teenage moments, but for the most part, the mild language, alcohol consumption, and marijuana use aren’t glorified and rather simply serve a storytelling purpose. For viewers who are more sensitive to violence, there are several scenes with minor amounts of blood, but Cruel Summer doesn’t indulge in gore. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDB’s parent’s guid</a>e has a full list of the moments that could be considered problematic, but it could be argued that the conversation Cruel Summer’s main story presents is well worth the minor exposure to depiction of illegal substances.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Season two is well on its way to solidifying itself as a head scratching mystery, though it hosts an older cast and deals with an entirely different set of problems. The series’ showrunners have promised to continue exploring the tribulations of teenagerhood in as nuanced of a light as possible, so it’s safe to say that they will maintain their TV-14 rating going forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZi%2FtrHLZqqupZ2av26%2BwK2cnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lou-dobbs-net-worth-165234.html><span>←</span><span>Lou Dobbs Net Worth</span></a>
