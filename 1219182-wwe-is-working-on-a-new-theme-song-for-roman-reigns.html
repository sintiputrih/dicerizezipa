We can’t just hire a rapper and check out this guitar riff. It can’t be some rock music. The Shield music, I wasn’t even really into it back in the day; but over the years, it just started working. You get so used to it that I just time my pace to it. But yeah, it takes some time and it has to be right.”</p><p>“In order to move away from something you’ve had for so long and is so recognizable like the music that I have now, it’s got to be perfect. It’s taking some time, but we’re definitely working on it, so please be patient.”</p><p>Reigns has been using the same theme ever since he debuted with The Shield in 2012, but this would mark the latest major change for his WWE character. Reigns&nbsp;also kept their trademark tactical vest as he branched out as a singles star, but finally ditched it and went shirtless starting with his&nbsp;match against Jey Uso at Clash Of Champions on September 27. (Some halfwits might have you believe he needed the vest to hide his “protective hernia belt”, but it was just an aesthetic change. Reigns <a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed</a> as much himself in September.)</p><p>Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose each adopted their own look and theme as they branched out on their own, but fans have been asking for Roman to do the same since then. According to Reigns, the music part is finally going to happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFqcGpwYmLEuLGMoqpmr5%2BnuKq6xmamp2WRYrumw4ytn56llWLAsLrGZp2oql2nvK6tzWapnqGXo8A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-fastest-woman-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>Who is the Fastest Woman of All Time?</span></a>
