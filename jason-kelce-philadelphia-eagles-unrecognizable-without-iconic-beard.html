But the Philadelphia Eagles center once adopted a fresh-faced look, which will&nbsp;leave NFL fans completely stunned.
In November 2012, Jason completely shaved off his beard for the Movember charity campaign.
And he completed&nbsp;the look with a twirly handlebar mustache, with fans comparing the NFL star to former baseball player Rollie Fingers.
