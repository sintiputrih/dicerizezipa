Livelihoods in Newport during the time were built off of trade and export businesses (mostly centered on candles, fish, furniture, rum, and silver) made profitable by the easy access to Newport harbor.</p><p>During the Revolutionary War, Newport became a hotbed for promoting independence and as a result, the British occupied the town from 1776 to 1779. Though they were eventually driven out and the colonists won the war, Newport had a long road to recovery from an economic standpoint. The trade route that once brought so much riches to the city was now bypassed thanks to the Industrial Revolution, which Newport wasn’t yet a part of. However, this gave Newport a more relaxed vibe, which was soon noticed by artists and intellectuals who helped turn Newport into a summer getaway destination.</p><p>It didn’t take long for those in the big city to become intrigued by what was going on in Newport, and Newport began to attract wealthy businessmen and their families who built summer homes in Newport for some rest and relaxation. The height of this was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, before the Great Depression. The era was full of glitz, glamour and gross opulence and came to be known as the Gilded Age. Residents of Newport utilized the harbor once again, but this time for yachting and sport instead of trade and commerce.</p><p>The Gilded Age was mostly prominent due to political corruption and social and economic turmoil that eventually needed to be addressed. As new government requirements and restrictions were imposed, the excess wealth that made the Gilded Age possible started to vanish.</p><p>T<span>he last half of the 20th century, however, saw a return of visitors sweeping down on the beautiful landscape of Newport to spend their summers. Tourism continues to be a big part of the city’s economy. A large part of the appeal is seeing so many historic structures all in one place, which can be credited to the number of preservation organizations that have fought to save many of these buildings over the past several decades. During a cruise to Newport, Rhode Island, You can experience for yourself what drew in the original settlers and upper-class society of Newport and which still entices people to this day.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSusLPByKycrGaTpLpwus5op6iqpKh8r7HWqaarrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marquis-grissom.html><span>←</span><span>Marquis Grissom</span></a>
