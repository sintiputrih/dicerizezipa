You need friction that converts this kinetic energy into heat to reduce the vehicle speed and stop your car.&nbsp;</p><p>Your <a href=#>car brakes</a> provide this friction.&nbsp;</p><p>How?&nbsp;<br>All modern vehicles come equipped with hydraulic brakes. When you press the brake pedal, you force a connected piston into the <a href=#>master cylinder</a>. The master cylinder contains hydraulic fluid (brake fluid) and is connected to a <a href=#>wheel cylinder</a> (drum brake) or <a href=#>brake caliper</a> (disc brake) on each wheel via a brake line.&nbsp;</p><p>As the amount of brake fluid or hydraulic fluid being pushed into a wheel cylinder remains the same, it creates hydraulic pressure. The hydraulic system multiplies the force applied on the <a href=#>brake pedal</a> and splits it between the four wheels of your car.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending upon your car’s brake type, the brake fluid pressure reaches the wheel cylinders or brake calipers. The hydraulic pressure presses the brake pads against a rotor disc (in a disc brake) or brake shoe against a drum (in a drum brake.) This action produces enough friction to stop your vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, modern cars have disc brakes with a rotor on the front wheels and a drum brake on the rear brakes. But, expensive models may have a disc brake on all four wheels.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, both disc brakes and drum brakes come equipped with several safety features, like an ABS braking system or traction control, to give you better control in different driving conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>So what’s an ABS brake system?&nbsp;<br>Let’s find that out next.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=abs-brakes><strong>What’s An </strong><strong>ABS Brake System</strong><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>ABS brakes or the Anti Lock Braking System is a safety feature incorporated in aircraft and land vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles. This brake system prevents wheel lock-up and skidding during sudden braking or when braking on a slippery surface.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So how does an </strong><strong>Anti Lock Braking System</strong><strong> work?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Anti Lock Brake System is an automated system based on threshold braking and cadence braking.&nbsp;</p><p>In ABS brakes, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) monitors a car’s wheel speed via wheel speed sensors (ABS sensor).&nbsp;</p><p>When a wheel sensor detects a possible wheel lock, it relays the data to the ECU, which releases and applies braking pressure rapidly (20 times per second) to prevent the wheel from locking up.&nbsp;</p><p>This helps maintain control over your vehicle, even during sudden braking or heavy braking. That said, ABS may increase the braking distance while improving steering control.</p><p>Curious to know more about anti lock brakes?<br>Let’s go over its components.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4-main><strong>4 Main Components Of An </strong><strong>ABS Brake System</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Here’s an overview of the primary ABS components:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-wheel-speed-sensors>A. Wheel Speed Sensors</h3><p>A <a href=#>wheel speed sensor</a> determines the speed of an individual wheel. These sensors use a toothed wheel and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-b-valves>B. Valves</h3><p>Each brake line contains a valve controlled by the antilock braking system. When it’s in position one or open, the brake fluid pressure from the master cylinder reaches the brakes.&nbsp;</p><p>At position two, the valve blocks the line and isolates the brake from the master cylinder to prevent pressure from rising further during hard braking.&nbsp;</p><p>In position three, the valve releases the brake fluid pressure.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-c-pump>C. Pump</h3><p>The pump’s function is to restore hydraulic pressure to the ABS brakes after the valves have released brake pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-d-controller>D. Controller</h3><p>The <a href=#>ABS control module</a> (or controller) is an electronic unit that receives data from an individual wheel speed sensor.&nbsp;</p><p>If a wheel loses traction, the wheel speed sensor sends the signal to the ABS controller, which limits the brake force.&nbsp;</p><p>The ABS control module often works in tandem with traction control and electronic stability control to offer a safer driving experience, especially during emergency braking.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you know what an ABS braking system is, it also makes sense to know the different ABS types.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5-abs><strong>5 ABS Types</strong></h2><p>You can differentiate ABS braking systems based on the number of channels or valves individually controlled by the ABS controller and the number of wheel speed sensors (ABS sensor.)&nbsp;</p><p>Accordingly, anti lock brakes can fall under five categories.&nbsp;<br>These are:&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-four-channel-four-sensor-abs>1. Four-Channel, Four-Sensor ABS</h3><p>A&nbsp; four channel or four wheel abs has a speed sensor installed on each front and rear wheel, and has a separate valve for each wheel.&nbsp;</p><p>The ABS control unit monitors each wheel individually to ensure maximum braking force.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-three-channel-four-sensor-abs>2. Three-Channel, Four-Sensor ABS</h3><p>This anti lock brake system has a speed sensor on each wheel and a valve for each front wheel. But there’s a common valve for the rear tires.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-three-channel-three-sensor-abs>3. Three-Channel, Three-Sensor ABS</h3><p>This ABS system has a speed sensor and valve on each front wheel. But there’s only one valve and one sensor for both rear wheels. The rear sensor is located on the rear axle.&nbsp;</p><p>This type of ABS is commonly found on pickup trucks.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-two-channel-four-sensor-abs>4. Two-Channel, Four-Sensor ABS</h3><p>This variation has a speed sensor on each wheel but only one valve for both front and rear tires.&nbsp;</p><p>So, when the ABS controller detects a wheel lockup, it pulses the valve for both front or rear car wheels. This system is commonly found in old passenger cars.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-one-channel-one-sensor-abs>5. One-Channel, One-Sensor ABS</h3><p>This anti lock braking system has only one valve for the rear brakes and one sensor on the rear axle.&nbsp;</p><p>Both rear wheels need to lock up for the ABS system to kick in. It’s commonly found on pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans.&nbsp;</p><p>But why are ABS brakes the toast of the town?&nbsp;<br>What are the benefits?&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s find out.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4-advantages><strong>4 Advantages Of ABS</strong></h2><p>Here are the four primary benefits of having an antilock braking system in your vehicle:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp; Enhanced Stopping Power: </strong>ABS brakes significantly reduce the chances of a wheel lock during hard braking. This prevents vehicle skidding, especially on a slippery surface.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Decreased Insurance Costs</strong>: ABS brakes can lower the risks of accidents, thereby keeping your insurance payments under check.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Enhanced Resale Value:</strong> ABS is a standard feature in most vehicles today. Not having one means that your vehicle will have a lesser <a href=#>resale value</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Improves Traction Control: </strong>ABS systems and advanced traction control share the same infrastructures. This makes it easier and cost-effective for manufacturers to install traction control along with ABS in the factory.&nbsp;</p><p>With all that ABS info under your belt, let’s move on to some brake FAQs.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3-faqs><strong>3 FAQs About </strong><strong>Car Brakes</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Here are answers to some common car brakes related questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=different-brakes>1. What Are The Different Types Of Car Brakes?&nbsp;</h3><p>There are generally three types of car brakes:&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-disc-brakes>A. Disc Brakes</h4><p>A <a href=#>disc brake</a> comprises a disc rotor (brake rotor) attached directly to the wheel and a wheel caliper that holds the brake pads against a brake rotor.&nbsp;</p><p>The hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder causes the wheel caliper to press the <a href=#>brake pad</a> on either side of the brake rotors. The resulting friction from a brake pad slows and stops your vehicle.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-b-drum-brakes>B. Drum Brakes&nbsp;</h4><p>Drum brakes feature a brake drum attached to the inside of the wheel.&nbsp;</p><p>When brake force is exerted through the brake pedal, it causes the hydraulic pressure to press the brake shoe with brake lining (friction material) against the brake drum.&nbsp;</p><p>This generates the braking force, causing your vehicle to stop.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-c-emergency-brake>C. Emergency Brake</h4><p>Also known as a <a href=#>parking brake</a>, the emergency brake is a secondary braking system in your vehicle. It works independently of the conventional brakes and is powered by cables to apply mechanical brake pressure on all wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A parking brake helps keep a vehicle stationary when parked. But you can also use it for emergency braking if the conventional brakes fail.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=new-cars>2. Do All New Cars Have An ABS Brake System?</h3><p>All new brakes (hydraulic brakes) come with an anti lock braking system as standard.&nbsp;</p><p>As of September 2012, the USA’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration mandated ABS brakes and Electronic Stability Control on all vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, since 2004, ABS has been mandatory on all new passenger cars sold in the EU.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=abs-light>3. What To Do If I See My ABS Light On?</h3><p>An illuminated ABS light indicates that your ABS brakes are failing and might stop working soon.&nbsp;</p><p>However, ensure that the light points to a <a href=#>malfunctioning ABS</a> and not the primary brake kit. So check your primary brake system first for issues like:</p><ul><li>Excess brake dust</li><li>Brake fade</li><li>Warped rotor</li><li>Worn brake pads or brake lining&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Else, if the brakes feel squishy, it could indicate air in the <a href=#>brake fluid</a>, for which you’ll need to bleed the <a href=#>brake line</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wrapping-up><strong>Wrapping Up&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Car brakes with an anti-lock braking system are a crucial feature that can help prevent a nerve-wracking incident on the road.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you’re facing any glitch in your car brakes or the ABS, contact <a href=#><strong>AutoNation Mobile Service</strong></a>.</p><p>With <a href=#>AutoNation Mobile Service</a>, you get:</p><ul><li><strong>Convenient, online booking </strong>for any brake service</li><li><strong>Expert technicians </strong>to perform diagnosis and brake repair</li><li><strong>Competitive </strong>and <strong>upfront pricing</strong></li><li>A <strong>12-month | 12,000-mile warranty</strong> on all brake parts and repairs</li></ul><p><a href=#>Contact us</a>, and our mechanics will drop by to do any brake repair, like fixing squeaky brakes, replacing brake calipers or pads, tire rotation, or installing a new brake kit right in your driveway!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7osHTqKWarJmku667waKjnquVp8Oqr8RnmqilX558o7jOoGacmaJir7Otyp6qZqupqMGmudJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-feucht.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Feucht Wiki (Politician) Age, Wife, Biography, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
