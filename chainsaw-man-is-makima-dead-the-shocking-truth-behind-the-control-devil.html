<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Chainsaw Man is Makima Dead: The Shocking Truth Behind the Control Devil</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Chainsaw Man is a popular manga and anime series that has captivated millions of fans with its dark, violent, and unpredictable story. One of the most intriguing and mysterious characters in the series is Makima, a high-ranking devil hunter who takes in the protagonist Denji as her human pet. But is Makima really who she seems to be, and is she dead or alive by the end of the series? In this article, we will reveal the shocking truth behind Makima’s identity, motives, and fate, and how they are connected to the Chainsaw Man.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Makima?</h2><p>Makima appears to be a kind, gentle, and friendly woman who cares for Denji and his friends. She is also a powerful and respected devil hunter who leads the Tokyo Special Division 4 and 5, and has a contract with the Prime Minister of Japan. However, as the series progresses, it is revealed that Makima is actually the Control Devil, one of the Four Horsemen who embodies the fear of control or conquest. She has been manipulating many characters in the series, including Denji, Aki, and Power, in order to achieve her ultimate goal: to become the Chainsaw Man.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why does Makima want to become the Chainsaw Man?</h2><p>The Chainsaw Man is a legendary devil who has the power to erase other devils from existence by killing them. Makima wants to use this power to create a better world, according to her own twisted vision. She believes that humans are weak and foolish, and need to be controlled and guided by a superior being like her. She also wants to eliminate the devils that she considers to be unnecessary evils, such as the Gun Devil, the Darkness Devil, and the Future Devil. To do this, she needs to obtain the Chainsaw Man’s heart, which is actually Pochita, Denji’s former devil companion who fused with him and gave him the ability to transform into the Chainsaw Man.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How does Makima die?</h2><p>Makima’s plan is foiled by Denji, who manages to resist her control and confront her in a final battle. Denji realizes that Makima only sees him as a tool, and that she killed his friends Aki and Power. He also learns that Makima has a contract with the Prime Minister of Japan, which allows her to transfer any damage done to her to a random Japanese citizen. This makes her seemingly invincible, as she can survive being shot, stabbed, or blown up. However, Denji finds a way to bypass this contract and kill Makima for good. He chops her up and eats her, while holding onto his feelings of love for her. This prevents Makima’s contract from activating, as it only works if a malicious attack is carried out against her. By eating Makima’s remains, Denji also separates and distributes them across the country, preventing her from regenerating. Makima then dies and returns to hell, freeing the world from her tyranny.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Makima come back to life?</h2><p>Although Makima is dead, the Control Devil is not. The Control Devil reincarnates in China as a young girl named Nayuta, who is brought to Denji by his mentor Kishibe. Kishibe convinces Denji to take Nayuta in and keep an eye on her, as she could potentially become another Makima in the future. However, Denji decides to give Nayuta a chance, and treats her with kindness and affection. He also learns from Pochita that the Control Devil only ever wanted to create genuine connections with people, but was corrupted by the fear and hatred of humans. Pochita asks Denji to show Nayuta the same kindness that changed Pochita’s heart, and Denji agrees. Since then, Nayuta has not shown any signs of evil, and seems to be living a peaceful and happy life with Denji.</p><p>Chainsaw Man is Makima dead is one of the most shocking and controversial questions in the series, as it reveals the true nature and fate of one of the main characters. Makima is the Control Devil, who wanted to become the Chainsaw Man and rule the world with an iron fist. She was killed by Denji, who ate her and stopped her contract with the Prime Minister of Japan. However, the Control Devil reincarnated as Nayuta, who is now being raised by Denji with love and care. Whether Nayuta will follow Makima’s footsteps or not remains to be seen, but for now, she seems to be enjoying her new life with Denji. Chainsaw Man is a series that never ceases to surprise and amaze its fans, and we can’t wait to see what happens next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfmLWitc2smLBlnZa7brXSZqSao5mirm6wxJqbZqyYmnq0tM6coqKml2LBs8HToWSbnZieu6V506GcZpufo8Gzu8tmm56umaF8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-brian-scalabrine-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Brian Scalabrine Dating Now</span></a>
