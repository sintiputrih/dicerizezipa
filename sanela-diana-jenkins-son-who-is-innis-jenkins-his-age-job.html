His parents shared their wedding vows in 1999 but got divorced in 2011.</p><p>Sanela is the official cast member of season 12 of The Real Housewives of Beverley Hills. She is an entrepreneur who runs Neuro, a beverage company. She also purchased the swimwear line Melissa Odabash and D Empire Entertainment, which is described on their website as a “full-service music label”.</p><p>Sanela featured Innis and Eliyanah in December 2021. She captioned the post, “Very suspenseful book lol”.</p><p>However, Sanela took a long journey from rags to riches. She was a Bosnian refugee who dedicated her life to advocacy for the last 20 years. She launched several advocacy programs, including UCLA’s Sanela Diana Jenkins Human Rights Project and the Jenkins-Penn Haitian Relief Organization, which she formed with actor Sean Penn.</p><p>Sanela was also named one of the World’s Top Three Justice Innovations by The Hague Institute, according to her foundation’s website. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Diana is worth $300 million.</p><p>Sanela is currently in a relationship with her R&B singer boytoy Asher Monroe. ‘After my divorce, I was single for about five minutes,’ Diana said. ‘I met Asher at a Victoria Secret’s party. It was never meant to be anything else, and just kept having fun, and here we are.’</p><p>They welcomed a child named Eliyanah on 25 November 2020. Now, she is the mother of three children.</p><p>Innis’s father dated a few women after his divorce from Sanela. Some of the notable names were Elle Macpherson and former Miss Venezuela Aida Yespica. Then, he met and married <a href=#>Larissa Andrade</a> in August 2018.</p><h3><strong>Innis Jenkins Age</strong></h3><p>As of May 2022, Innis Jenkins is 22 years old.</p><h3><strong>Innis Jenkins Job</strong></h3><p>According to Innis Jenkins’s IG, he is an entrepreneur. Innis is affiliated with MetaForceX. According to MetaForceX’s website, it is a community merging the web3 and IRL worlds exploring the real-world benefits of web3. They listed decentralized systems, action-based identity, borderless exchange of ideas, and near costless global transactions as some of the aforementioned benefits.</p><p>They further stated, “We’re onboarding confused IRL culture leaders and normies alike. And bringing the web3 native leaders to help assist with the transition. Everyone in the community has equal standing. If you’re a doxed public figure, you will be asked to assume an anon identity”.</p><p>The company is doing all of this to build a metaverse and building a video game.</p><p>You can find them on Instagram (<a href=#>@metaforcex</a>) and Twitter (<a href=#>@metaforcex</a>). Medium has also done an article on the company. The writer of the article stated that MetaForceX will come together as a community digitally and IRL to raise money for charity, and network (while exploring the flywheel of innovation happening around us) while seeking to onboard IRL talent to further expand that Web3 flywheel.</p><p>Learn more about the company <a href=#>here</a>.</p><h3><strong>Is Innis Jenkins Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Back in November 2021, Innis Jenkins posted a picture of himself getting cozy with his alleged girlfriend. That is in fact the only picture on his Instagram. But there is no information on the girl’s identity. One of his followers tweeted, “No face no case”.</p><p>Same followers previously commented, “Keep em guessing”.</p><p>While not much is obtainable from Innis’s socials, Ava’s IG spoke a lot compared to Innis’s. They were recently spotted holding hands together while attending Coachella. She featured him in March 2021 quoting, “<span class="_7UhW9 xLCgt MMzan KV-D4 se6yk T0kll">my date 🖤”. They were attending an event hosted by Diana’s company.</span></p><p>But, our research shows that Innis is dating Ava Dash, author and fashion designer Rachel Roy’s daughter. She was reportedly dating Conor Kennedy, the ex of Taylor Swift. Ava works with young adults that have aged out of the foster care system as well as former sex trafficked girls in India. Inspired by her travels with her mother, Ava hopes to start a give-back business that provides critical resources to educate and empower the girls she has met on her travels to India.</p><p>Ava and Connor made their first outing as a couple in June 2021. They appeared at an LGBTQ fundraiser in the Hamptons. The insider says the couple met in 2019 through mutual friends, but they “never really bonded until they both stayed at a friend’s house in the Hamptons for Conor’s birthday weekend last August.”</p><h3><strong>Innis Jenkins Height</strong></h3><p>Innis Jenkins stands tall to the height of 6 feet.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Does Innis Jenkins Live?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Innis Jenkins lives in Los Angeles, California.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Has Innis Jenkins Made His TV Debut Yet?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Innis Jenkins is yet to make his TV debut yet.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Innis Jenkin’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Innis Jenkins celebrates his birthday on 24 July.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrJmemrmiecOimKeZXZ%2Byr7fIp6pmq5%2Bjeri0zmagrGWZo7uqv4yjnKejmaPAbrTIrGSan5Vit7Cujg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jon-gutwillig-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jon Gutwillig Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
