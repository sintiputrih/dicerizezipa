Where does public nudity fit into Ron Swanson's Pyramid of Greatness? Esquire magazine just released its sublime April 2015 cover, featuring a fully naked Chelsea Handler showing off her bare butt.
It's not unusual to see Handler nude — topless photos abound on her Twitter feed — but this time she has a partner in crime: the very funny Nick Offerman. Both stand with their backs (and bums) to the camera, hands interlocked, toes overlapping, as they look nonchalantly over their shoulders, mimicking John Lennon and Yoko Ono's nearly identical photo from their 1968 Two Virgins album.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fwends Forever: How Miley Cyrus and Wayne Coyne Became BFFs: A Timeline</h2><time>Sep 3, 2024</time>

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headquarters are pictured in Langley, Virginia, on July 8, 2022.
An ex-CIA programmer has been convicted by a federal jury of sending thousands of classified files about the agency’s covert techniques and spying tools to WikiLeaks, which published them under the name “Vault 7” in 2017.
The month of its release, authorities searched the home of ex-CIA coder Joshua Adam Schulte and later charged him in connection with the record-breaking leaks.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/21/>← Prev Page</a>
