While some people might only know him for his dashing looks, die-hard fans will remember Taylor for his impressive repertoire of misdeeds. From his hyper-masculine alpha attitude to impregnating a porn star in Las Vegas while dating another Vanderpump star, and even getting entangled with Tom Sandoval‚Äôs then-girlfriend ‚Äì his list of shenanigans seems never-ending. But let‚Äôs not dive too deep into that rabbit hole.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=604 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>It‚Äôs safe to say that Taylor‚Äôs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popularity skyrocketed </a>during the show‚Äôs airing, but he quickly acquired the title of the show‚Äôs resident villain ‚Äì and rightfully so. Surprisingly, though, Taylor has managed to keep a relatively low profile since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his departure from the reality series</a>, all the while maintaining his influence in the entertainment world. What‚Äôs even more astonishing is that none of his recent endeavors involve cozying up to a certain Andrew Tate (not yet, at least). So, without further ado, let‚Äôs find out what Jax Taylor has been up to these days.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-jax-taylor-doing-after-vanderpump-rules data-injectable=false>What is Jax Taylor doing after Vanderpump Rules?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brittany Cartwright Cauchi üíõ (@brittany)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>You may be as surprised as we were to discover that Taylor has left his contentious past behind, and has since become a fully devoted husband and doting father. The same guy who once made nuns blush with his wild escapades has transformed into an ordinary Joe, fully committed to the blissful chaos of family life. At the age of 43, in the three years since his departure from the show, he has become the epitome of a loving husband to Brittany Cartwright and a proud parent to their two-year-old son, Cruz.</p><p data-characters=609 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>When he‚Äôs not playing with his son, he‚Äôs been keeping himself busy as an entrepreneur. Together with his wife, Taylor has been selling merch with their catchphrases ‚Äú#1 Guy in the Group‚Äù and ‚ÄúRawt in Hail.‚Äù Moreover, the duo also co-hosts the podcast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">When Reality Hits With Jax and Brittany </a>aside from hosting a Vanderpump Rules watch-along special on Peacock. And that‚Äôs not all. Taylor has also been engrossed in the world of reality TV once more after he filmed a pilot for a new reality series, House of Villains, where famous reality-TV villains compete in an epic showdown.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Owning up to his mistakes at long last, Taylor seems to generally be trying to be a better version of himself and for the sake of his family, we sure hope that‚Äôs exactly what happens. As for his cameo in House of Villains, the E! series still has no release date, but it is expected to premiere by the end of the year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZqWxW7AwLKjqKpdmbyqusZmpaivXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lydia-arleen-bio-parents-boyfriend-height-love-is-blind.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Lydia Arleen Parents, Boyfriend, Height, Who Is She?</span></a>
