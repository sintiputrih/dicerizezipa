One of the actress’s breakout roles came in 2007, when she acted alongside <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elliot Page,</a>&nbsp;</strong>36, in the beloved<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> coming-of-age film&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Juno</a>.&nbsp;She played the quirky best friend Leah to Elliot’s Juno, and her character is still beloved by many of the fans who grew up watching it. Over the years, she’s appeared in various roles, popping up in different films and TV shows.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elliot’s</a> new memoir&nbsp;Pageboy,&nbsp;he opens up about a variety of subjects, including<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> his gender identity,</a> coming out as trans, and his explorations of sexuality. In the book, Elliot reveals that he and Olivia <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got very close</a> while working on&nbsp;Juno.

He said that he immediately felt like<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> she was “sexually open,”</a> and he was immediately taken. “The chemistry was palpable, it pulled me in,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>He said that they stared spending tons of quality time together, and that when they both admitted that they were attracted to one another, they started to have sex regularly. “I had an all-encompassing desire for her, she made me want in a way that was new, hopeful,” he said. “We thought we were being subtle. Being intimate with Olivia helped my shame dissipate. I didn’t see a glint of it in her eyes and I wanted that — done feeling wretched about who I am.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Olivia-Thirlby-Elliot-Page-juno-everett-embed-3.jpg><h2>Besides ‘Juno,’ Olivia has starred in ‘No Strings Attached’, ‘Y: The Last Man’, and more.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>While&nbsp;Juno&nbsp;is one of her most well-known roles, Olivia has appeared in a wide variety of projects over the years. She made her debut in the 2006 film&nbsp;United 93.&nbsp;Some of her other major movies include the&nbsp;<strong>Ashton Kutcher&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Natalie Portman</strong>-starring romcom&nbsp;No Strings Attached&nbsp;(2011), and the TV series&nbsp;The L Word: Generation Q.&nbsp;Most recently, she starred as Hero Brown in the series&nbsp;Y: The Last Man and in the 2022 short&nbsp;Artist In A Field.&nbsp;</p><h2>She’s bisexual</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Olivia came out as bisexual in a 2012 interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brooklyn Magazine</a>.&nbsp;She spoke openly about her sexual orientation while discussing a photo project she was taking part in. “For me personally it’s important to be a part of this because I feel it’s a way of me showing gratitude that I live surrounded by a community in which I don’t have to hide my sexual orientation. And no one should have to hide their sexual orientation,” she said. “I am not one hundred percent straight.”</p><h2>She’s married to Jacques Pienaar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Olivia-Thirlby-Elliot-Page-juno-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>In 2012, Olivia met&nbsp;<strong>Jacques Pienaar&nbsp;</strong>while working on the film&nbsp;Dredd.&nbsp;While she starred, he was a boom operator.
