The &#34;Bodak Yellow&#34; rapper shared a close-up shot of her face, from a February photo shoot, on her Instagram Story yesterday, showing off the new design.
The tat, in red ink, reads, &#34;Wave,&#34; in cursive and is located along Cardi's jawline.
The photo shoot, in which she debuted the tattoo, was posted on Valentine's Day, February 14, but somehow many fans missed the detail when scrolling through the glossy photos at the time."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
