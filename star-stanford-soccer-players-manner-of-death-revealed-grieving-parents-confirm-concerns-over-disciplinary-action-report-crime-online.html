This letter was kind of the final letter that there was going to be a trial or some kind of something. This is the only thing that we can come up with that triggered something.”</p><p>The details of the incident that led to a discussion of potential disciplinary action are not yet known.</p><p>“Our entire community is devastated by Katie’s death, and we share our deepest condolences with Katie’s family and everyone who knew her at Stanford, across the country and around the world,” Stanford Univesity officials said in a statement issued to “Today.”</p><p>“Katie touched so many lives.
