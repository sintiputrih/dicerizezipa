Bennett, a piece that eagle-eyed royal fans will recognize from 2011. She also wore the coat during a vacation to Switzerland in 2013 and was seen wearing the same jacket in 2012 when she was taking her dog, Lupo, out for a walk. For the new video, she paired the coat with another favorite, a Holland Cooper Fair Isle turtleneck sweater, which she's also worn in the past. Most recently, the statement-making sweater made an appearance in Dec. 2022, when Kate wore it to decorate a Christmas tree.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The video shows Kate and Kemp having a frank discussion about the importance of mental health while taking in the countryside near Hertfordshire, England. Shaping Up aims to bring attention to the early childhood years (up to age 5, according to the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Independent</a>), which includes both physical and mental health.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The campaign is fundamentally about shining a spotlight on the critical importance of early childhood and how it shapes the adults we become," Kate said in a speech. "During this time we lay the foundations and building blocks for life. And it is when we learn to understand ourselves, understand others, and understand the world in which we live."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrnmWdnrGluMStpqdlnKB6o7HNp5ytrF2YvKLAjKyfmqiZo7Ruwc9mraKclaR6eH2Pbm1vbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julie-andrews-biography-age-husband-surgery-ellen-white-net-worth-films-songs-and-books-2.html><span>←</span><span>Julie Andrews Biography, Age, Husband, Surgery, Ellen White, Net Worth, Films, Songs and Books</span></a>
