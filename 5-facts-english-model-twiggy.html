Named Dame Lesley Lawson at birth, the model adopted the nickname Twiggy, which was given to her by family and friends because of her twig-like body frame.</strong></p><p>Many models have come and gone, and high fashion has evolved greatly since the early sixties but we cannot talk about those who changed the game without mentioning English supermodel Twiggy. In an era where only the most curvaceous women were deemed worthy of superstardom, Twiggy stole the show with her willowy, almost tomboyish looks, and defined the entire industry during the late 20th century.</p><p>She is also considered to be one of the world’s first ‘real’ supermodels, appearing on the covers of all the top fashion magazines in the world. In her prime, she was the IT Girl of the sixties and was widely regarded as a cultural icon.</p><p>Her signature look was her blond short hair, ultra-thick lashes, and heavily-lined huge eyes together with her twig-like frame. Twiggy was such a worldwide cultural phenomenon that her illustrious fashion career reached untold heights in just four years with appearances on the cover of premium magazines like Vogue and Elle. Later on, when she was just 21 years old, she became the lead star in Ken Russell’s 1971 movie, The Boy Friend, and has not slowed down for anything or anyone since then.</p><h3><strong>Twiggy’s Profile Summary</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Birth Name:</strong> Lesley Hornby</li><li><strong>Stage Name:</strong> Twiggy</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> September 19, 1949</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 74 Year Old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Neasden, Middlesex, United Kingdom</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> English</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Brondesbury and Kilburn High School</li><li><strong>Zodiac:</strong> Virgo</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Model, Singer, Actress, Activist, Philanthropist</li><li><strong>Height:</strong> 5 Feet 6 Inches</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 51 kg</li><li><strong>Body Measurements:</strong> 31-23-32 (bust, waist, and hips respectively)</li><li><strong>Eye Color:</strong> Blue</li><li><strong>Hair Color:</strong> Light Brown</li><li><strong>Spouse(s):</strong> Michael Witney (m. 1977 – 1983), Leigh Lawson (m. 1988)</li><li><strong>Children:</strong> Carly Witney</li><li><strong>Father:</strong> William Norman Hornby</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Nellie Lydia Hornby</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Shirley Hornby, Vivien Hornby</li><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $50 million</li></ul><h2><strong>Twiggy Is English</strong></h2><p>The superstar was born Leslie Hornby on the 19th of September 1949 in London to lower-middle-class parents, William Hornby (father) and Nellie Lydia Hornby (mother). She was the last of three children, having two older sisters named Shirley (born in 1934) and Vivien (born in 1942).</p><p>All three children were raised by their carpenter father and tailor mother in Neasden in London, England. A few sources have said that Twiggy was extremely close to her mother while growing up, but the model herself revealed that her mother suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after giving birth to her and as a result, she was raised mostly by her sister, Shirley, who was 15 years older than her.</p><p>Twiggy attended the Brondesbury & Kilburn High School in Queen’s Park, England. When she was about sixteen, she began working at a hairdressing salon and was selected to participate in a photoshoot for a new haircut that the stylist wanted to debut. The result was that she caught the attention of fashion journalist Deirdre McSharry and this was the start of Twiggy’s rise to worldwide fame.</p><h2><strong>She Began Her Career As A Model But Has Become Much More Than Just A Model Over Time</strong></h2><p>Twiggy’s modeling career lasted for only four years but the impact of her work was no less potent. She worked with photographers like Bert Stern, Richard Avedon, Helmut Newton, Terence Donovan, and Barry Lategan during the course of those four years. She has admitted that her greatest influence was the beautiful Jean Shrimpton, a woman widely considered to be the first supermodel. Her androgynous look, however, appears to have been an imitation of Pattie Boyd’s tomboyish appearance.</p><p>Her career, as previously stated, began when she was only 16 years old. At the time, she was discovered by Deirdre McSharry from the Daily Express and got massive exposure from that fateful photo shoot. This all began in 1967.</p><p>Although she was short for a model, at a height of 5 feet 6 inches, her thin frame more than covered up for it and made her appear taller. Her boyfriend, who was a hairdresser named Nigel Davies, named her Twiggy as an ode to her frame that according to her friends, “resembled a twig.”</p><p>He later became her manager for the next seven years and even changed his name to Justin de Villeneuve, so he could better embody the image of a sophisticated manager. Soon, Twiggy was on the covers of all the leading fashion magazines and earning as much as £80 per hour.</p><p>Not long after, she added “businesswoman” to her repertoire following the launch of her clothing line, Twiggy Dresses in 1967, which was the rave of the entire fashion world. In the same year, she launched a couple of products in her name and image, including Twiggy pens, Twiggy lunch boxes, Twiggy cosmetics, and Twiggy lashes. She also launched an eponymous line of clothing for other women, further encouraging people to look like her.</p><p>After business, she delved into acting, debuting in 1971 in the Ken Russell movie, The Devils. Shortly after, she was featured in many other movies like The Boy Friend (1971), There Goes the Bride (1980), W (1974), The Blues Brothers (1980), The Doctor and the Devils (1985), Club Paradise (1986), Madame Sousatzka (1988), and Istanbul (1990).</p><p>She didn’t limit herself to only acting movie roles. Because of her Broadway experience, she also featured in some of the most popular television series of that period including, The Little Match Girl (1986), The Diamond Trap&nbsp;(1988), Body Bags (1993), Something Borrowed, Something Blue (1997), and Brand New World (1998).</p><p>Her television appearances stretched out to include musical shows and among the ones she appeared on is her self-titled show Twiggy (1975), The Muppet Show (1976), A Gift of Music (1981), Young Charlie Chapman (1989), and Absolutely Fabulous (2000). She also appeared as the judge of the fashion show, America’s Next Top Model (ANTM) for two years from 2005. After acting, music naturally followed and as a fledgling musician, she was invited to perform at Rodger Glover’s The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper’s Feast that took place at the Royal Albert Hall in London, in October 1975.</p><p>The following year, her music career took a more serious turn as she got signed to Mercury Records. Subsequently, she released her first two music albums under the record label. She released her first album, a self-titled album called Twiggy in 1976 while the second one, Please Get My Name Right, followed soon after, that same year. Her last album, Romantically Yours, was released in 2011 through EMI. In 2012, she collaborated with designers Marks & Spencer to launch an exclusive clothing collection for the M&S Woman range.</p><p>During the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the entertainer launched her podcast, Tea With Twiggy, an intimate show where she has had conversations with special guests like Elaine Page, Myleene Klass, David Threlfall, and Gyles Brandreth. Her age notwithstanding, Twiggy remains active in the entertainment industry to date.</p><h2><strong>Other Interesting Facts About Twiggy</strong></h2><h3><strong>1.
