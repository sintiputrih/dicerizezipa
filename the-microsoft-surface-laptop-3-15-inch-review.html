<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 (15-Inch) Review: AMD Ryzen Surface Edition</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>This year at Microsoft’s somewhat annual Surface update event, Microsoft surprised everyone by not only announcing a newer and larger Surface Laptop 3, bumping the screen size from 13.5-inches to 15-inches, but also by selecting an AMD processor for the laptop. Though still an incremental shift when looking at the entire Surface lineup, it was a big change for Microsoft, as well as a big win for AMD. Not only is Microsoft now offering a traditional, clamshell laptop in the ever-popular 15-inch form factor, but it's the highest profile laptop yet to ship with one of AMD's APUs.</p><p>While there's a lot more to the 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 than just its processor, certainly this is the highlight of the announcement. Up until now, Microsoft has relied exclusively on Intel processors for their entire range of x86 Surface devices. So this marks Microsoft's first departure from their long-time CPU provider, while highlighting a deeper connection between Microsoft and AMD that has grown from their Xbox work. And to be sure, it's beneficial to both parties – Microsoft gets a second supplier of x86 chips with a more graphics-heavy performance balance, and AMD gets a top-shelf laptop vendor that has gone the extra mile to optimize their setup.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/15008/Microsoft%20Surface%20Laptop%203%20AMD%20Ryzen%20Mobile%203_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Indeed, that optimization is perhaps the most important aspect of this latest partnership. While Microsoft and AMD perhaps go too far in touting the laptop's processor as "semi custom" – it's a specialized bin of AMD's existing Ryzen 3000 series Picasso APUs with a bit more graphics performance – what's not exaggerated is the work that the two parties have put into the final product. <a href=#>As we learned from AMD earlier this month</a>, a great deal of effort has been put into the&nbsp;firmware, the drivers, and the software stack for the AMD-powered Surface Laptop 3, and these days these factors are often as important as the hardware itself, since problems here can lead to bad experiences elsewhere. This is a level of effort and co-design work that goes beyond what's been done for any other Ryzen-powered laptops, and as a result, the Surface Laptop 3 is AMD's chance to show its best foot forward at a critical time.</p><p>Meanwhile, for the rest of the laptop, there's a good deal to unpack here as well. The larger design alone represents a significant change for the Surface Laptop family, giving Microsoft a laptop better sized to be used as a true desktop replacement machine. 15 inches means more room for a larger screen, more room for cooling, etc, resulting in a machine that's going to be a bit less portable than the 13.5-inch model, but arguably easier to work with over long periods of time. All the while, it's interesting just how much the new 15-inch model resembles the smaller Surface Laptop – every aspect of the design has been scaled up so that it feels like the same sharp machine as the 13.5-inch model.</p><p>For this generation of the Surface Laptop family, the Surface team has also changed one of the defining characteristics of lineup by making a version available without the Alcantara fabric keyboard deck. Discussing this with the designers, they said that owners with the synthetic fabric keyboard deck were overwhelmingly happy with it, despite fears of it getting dirty or damaged; but that they also heard from potential buyers who just prefer a more traditional aluminum feel. So for the 15-inch Surface Laptop 3, it's&nbsp;is aluminum only, available in Platinum or Black. Meanwhile the 13.5-inch model sees some similar changes, offering Sandstone, Black, or Platinum colors with a metal deck, or Cobalt Blue and Platinum colors with the Alcantara deck.</p><table align=center border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=635><tbody border=1 readability=34.5><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=8>Microsoft Surface Laptop 3<br>Model Tested: 15-inch Ryzen 5 3580U 16GB 256GB $1499</td></tr><tr class=tlblue readability=2><td width=86>&nbsp;</td><td align=center valign=middle width=268>13.5-Inch</td><td align=center valign=middle width=269>15-Inch (Intel)<br>Enterprise Only</td><td align=center valign=middle width=269>15-Inch (AMD)<br>Consumer</td></tr><tr readability=19.5><td class=tlgrey>Processor</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle readability=8><strong>Intel Core i5-1035G7</strong><br>4C/8T, 1.2-3.7GHz, 6MB L3, 10nm<p><strong>Intel Core i7-1065G7</strong><br>4C/8T, 1.3-3.9GHz, 8MB L3, 10nm</p></td><td align=center valign=middle readability=7><strong>AMD Ryzen 5 3580U</strong><br>4C/8T, 2.1-3.7GHz, 15w<p><strong>AMD Ryzen 7 3780U</strong><br>4C/8T, 2.3-4.0GHz, 15w</p></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=tlgrey>Memory</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>8 GB or 16 GB Dual-Channel LPDDR4X-3733</td><td align=center valign=middle>8/16/32GB Dual-Channel DDR4-2400</td></tr><tr readability=9.5><td class=tlgrey>Graphics</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle readability=6><strong>Intel Core i5-1035G7</strong><br>Intel Iris Plus "G7" Graphics (Gen 11, 64 EU)<p><strong>Intel Core i7-1065G7</strong><br>Intel Iris Plus "G7" Graphics (Gen 11, 64 EUs)</p></td><td align=center valign=middle readability=5><strong>AMD Ryzen 5 3580U</strong><br>Vega 9 Graphics (9 CUs)<p><strong>AMD Ryzen 7 3780U</strong><br>Vega 11 Graphics (11 CUs)</p></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=tlgrey>Display</td><td align=center valign=middle>13.5" 2256x1504 3:2 PixelSense<br>Touch and Pen support<br>Individually calibrated panels</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>15" 2496x1664 3:2 PixelSense<br>Touch and Pen support<br>Individually calibrated panels</td></tr><tr readability=9><td class=tlgrey>Storage</td><td align=center valign=middle>128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB PCIe NVMe</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB PCIe NVMe</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Networking</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>802.11ax<br>Bluetooth 5.0</td><td align=center valign=middle>802.11ac 2x2 MIMO<br>Bluetooth 5.0</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Audio</td><td align=center colspan=3 valign=middle>Omnisonic Speakers<br>Dolby Audio Premium</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Battery</td><td align=center colspan=3 valign=middle>46 Wh<br>60 + 5 W AC Adapter</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Right Side</td><td align=center colspan=3 valign=middle>Surface Connect Port</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Left Side</td><td align=center colspan=3 valign=middle>USB Type-A<br>USB Type-C<br>Headset Jack</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=tlgrey>Dimensions</td><td align=center valign=middle>308 x 223 x 14.51 mm (12.1 x 8.8 x 0.57 inches)</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>339.5 x 244 x 14.69 mm (13.4 x 9.6 x 0.57 inches)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Weight</td><td align=center valign=middle>Fabric: 1.25kg<br>Metal: 1.31kg</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>1.54kg</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Camera</td><td align=center colspan=3 valign=middle>Front: 720p Camera and Windows Hello support<br>Dual far-field Studio Mics</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Extras</td><td align=center colspan=3 valign=middle>Surface Pen and Dial (sold separately)<br>TPM 2.0</td></tr><tr readability=8><td class=tlgrey>Pricing</td><td align=center valign=middle>8GB/128GB/i5: $999<br>8GB/256GB/i5: $1299<br>16GB/256GB/i7: $1599<br>16GB/512GB/i7: $1999<br>16GB/1024GB/i7: $2399</td><td align=center valign=middle>Enterprise Sales Contract</td><td align=center valign=middle>8GB/128GB/R5: $1199<br>8GB/256GB/R5: $1499<br>16GB/256GB/R5: $1699<br>16GB/512GB/R7: $2099<br>32GB/1024GB/R7: $2799</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As is typical of the Surface lineup, Microsoft has stuck with the 3:2 aspect ratio which has served them so well, and with the same pixels-per-inch (PPI) of the 13.5-inch model, which results in a somewhat strange sounding 2496x1664 resolution. This is almost exactly 200 PPI, matching the smaller 13.5-inch model, but well short of the Surface Pro and Surface Book devices which come in around 270 PPI. It’s still a sharp display, with over double the density of a “standard” 96 PPI display, so while not quite as crisp as the Surface Pro and Surface Book, it’s still a good resolution and one that should help with battery life.</p><p>Microsoft has finally made the jump away from the Marvell network adapters that have been so prominent in their other products. Ice Lake-based devices (including the enterprise-only 15-inch Surface Laptop 3) get Intel's own Wi-Fi 6, while AMD systems get a Qualcomm Wi-Fi 5 solution that we're admittedly less than enthusiastic about. However, the good news is that Microsoft has finally embraced USB-C by supplanting the DisplayPort output with the more modern connector. It does not support Thunderbolt 3, but regardless it’s still a nice addition to the lineup since this was a feature that was certainly lacking from the last couple of generations. This doubles the number of USB ports from just a single USB-A port, to both USB-A and USB-C ports. And of course it still offers the Surface Connect port as well for charging and docking if necessary, further expanding the connectivity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH52fI9xZq2glWK6qq%2FRqKqonqRiwLa%2BxZqanmWclr21u89mamZpZWK2r6%2FHZqmerpmaxA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steven-cree.html><span>←</span><span>Steven Cree Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</span></a>
