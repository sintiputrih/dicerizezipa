The event coincided with the grand opening of a basketball court that Zendaya helped build and for its inaugural match, Holland spent some time shooting hoops while wearing a jersey that matched his girlfriend's.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;reports that Sydney Welch, who was in attendance, shared that Tom appeared as a "special guest" at the game. She shared a TikTok from the game that showed the couple in their matching Oakland jerseys.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Throughout the game, you could see Zendaya cheering her boyfriend on with hugs, small kisses and smiles," Welch said. "The event started at 12:30 and the basketball game lasted about an hour and a half where Tom Holland played on and off for 35 minutes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They both appeared in really good spirits and spent a lot of their time interacting with the community by taking pictures, signing merchandise and reconnecting with old friends and family," Welch added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last week, Zendaya opened up about her under-the-radar relationship in an interviw with&nbsp;Elle. While she and Holland seem to be one of the hottest couple in Hollywood, they're actually quite private and don't often make splashy appearances together. The actress explained that she understands the public part of their relationship, but notes that she's making sure to balance keeping things private and not "hiding" from attention.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Parts of my life, I accept, are going to be public," Zendaya said. "I can't not be a person and live my life and love the person I love. But also, I do have control over what I choose to share. It's about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can't hide. That's not fun, either. I am navigating it more than ever now."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK572Z6lnZmplnq1u8xmn6iknJa7pXnMmqucoJmjtG62xKuqnrGjYrCprdGiq7JlkpbArLHTm5ilpF2crq6xjKiYpKSRo7Fug5duam5vaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-ben-waites-agt-season-17-4788499.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Ben Waites?
