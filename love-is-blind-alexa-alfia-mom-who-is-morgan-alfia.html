Alexa and her partner were the first couples to get engaged in the pods. In the show, we meet her father Adam Alfia having a conversation with Brennon. “I can promise you 100 percent just like I want to promise her — I work every day,” the water treatment engineer tells his potential father-in-law. “I’ll work my a– off to give her the best life that she deserves.”</p><p>Alfia’s father, Adam, responds, “And I speak my mind. If I see you f–ing around and slacking off and not living up to your full potential, I’ll tell you.”</p><p>But who is Alexa’s mother Morgan? Find all that we know about her here in the show.</p><h3><strong>Meet Morgan Alfia, Love Is Blind Star Alexa Alfia Mom</strong></h3><p>Morgan Alfia is not Alexa Alfia’s mom, but her step-mom. Morgan married Alexa’s dad Adam Alfia. However, she has mentioned her mother briefly. In one video from June 2020 on her brother’s Facebook, Alexa shared that she hasn’t had the best relationship with her mom since she was 13.</p><p>Alexa carried a lot of emotions and feelings of hate that she felt towards her. But, when she moved to Israel, she let go of all the hatred and resentment she felt towards her mom. So, the closest thing to a mom she had was her beloved grandmother.</p><h3><strong>Morgan Alfia Husband And Kids</strong></h3><p>As stated earlier, Morgan Alfia is currently married to Adam Alfia. They tied the knot on <a href=#>28 June 2015</a> at the Joule Hotel in Dallas, Texas. The earliest post of the couple can be traced back to July 2014.</p><p>Currently, the couple doesn’t share any kids with each other.</p><p>In March 2020, Adam wished his wife, “Happy Birthday to the greatest woman, wife, mother, and best friend on the planet! <span class=xt0psk2>Morgan Alfia</span> you bring love and laughter to every person that knows you. Thank you for being all that you are. Today we forget about all the craziness that’s going on in the world around us and celebrate you, my Queen! I love you more than I can ever express.”</p><p>Meanwhile, on their 7th anniversary, Morgan posted on her IG, “Happy anniversary to the love of my life. 7 years married and 10 years together. I feel so fortunate to have that once-in-a-lifetime love. You are my life and soulmate. There is not a day that goes by that I don’t appreciate all you do for me. You always keep me laughing, smiling, and dancing. I knew it from our first date and I know it now, that we are forever. Love you, my King.”</p><p>They have lived in North Texas for the majority of their lives with their blended family including six children: 4 girls and 2 boys. Morgan’s daughter Sophia turned 12 years old on 28 September 2022. Her youngest daughter is named Emma.</p><p>As for the other children, she has a son named Aden Alfia who turned 22 years old in November 2022. Son Adam turned 15 years old in October 2022. She has two daughters; Alexa and Arielle.</p><p>Arielle is currently engaged to her fiance Patrick Kelly. As for her career, she is an undergraduate Teaching Assistant at <span class=xt0psk2>The University of Texas at Austin. She had also worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) at Brookdale Northwest Hills.</span></p><p>As for Alexa, she is currently 27 years old. She is working as <span>an Insurance Agent Owner at </span><i><span>Alexa Alfia Allstate Agency</span></i><span>. Besides this, she also is an Agency Owner of</span><i><span> Allstate</span></i><span> ever since August 2017. In 2022, she signed up for Netflix’s Love Is Blind, a reality dating show experiment.</span></p><p>In the show, she linked with Brennon Lemieux.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Morgan Alfia?</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Morgan Alfia is currently 33 years old. March 1989 marked the year she was born.</p><h3><strong>Morgan Alfia Job</strong></h3><p>Before giving birth to their youngest child, Emma, Morgan Alfia resigned from her job. Morgan was eager to begin her workout regimen because she had previously exercised frequently before finding out she was pregnant. She discovered that indoor cycling lessons were the best type of cardio and helped her rediscover her enthusiasm for exercise.</p><p>Morgan was motivated and made the decision to build a fitness center that incorporated all the aspects she like in other studios but had never seen all in one location. A top-notch cycling studio with Stages bikes, a strength studio with a range of weights, a cool and nutritious smoothie bar, and most crucially, a child care center to assist moms with children. Thus, she and her husband founded Neon.</p><p>She has been the owner of Neon Cycle + Strength since September 2018.</p><h3><strong>What Is Morgan Alfia Maiden Name?</strong></h3><p>The maiden name of Morgan Alfia is “Sandlin”.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Morgan Alfia On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Morgan Alfia is on Instagram (<a href=#>@mtalfia</a>) and Facebook (<a href=#>@morgan.sandlin</a>).</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Morgan Alfia Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Morgan Alfia celebrates her birthday on 21 March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpaemmnqqv4ybo6KmlGKurbHXmmSapJaerm65zqZksKCfYra0ecyoqaCZnmKurbLImmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-martin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675293-html.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Martin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
