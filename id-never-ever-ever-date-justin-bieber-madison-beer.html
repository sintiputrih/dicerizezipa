First of all, he’s like (a) big brother (so) never, but I would never in a million years use anyone and people think that goes on a lot in Hollywood.”</p><p>Madison also doesn’t have anything to worry about with her romantic status, as she is currently dating Jack & Jack singer Jack Gilinsky.</p><p>The 18-year-old singer became a worldwide sensation when Sorry singer Justin tweeted a video of her singing when she was just 13. He later signed Madison to Island Records, and the star has gone on to enjoy a successful career. But despite the 23-year-old singer being responsible for her fame, their relationship will always stay strictly professional if Madison has anything to do with it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqKbZqaVq7KzecSvnKtllauys3nDmqueZZqqwLW1zWaZop2Smr9uucCdoKynnmKvprHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hilary-duff-net-worth-150767.html><span>←</span><span>Hilary Duff Net Worth</span></a>
