If they don't do well on the test, they have no chance at earning a Chinese university degree, and face bleak job prospects.</p><p>Thus, students desperate to get a good score are known to take IV amino acid drips for studying energy and even enter hyperbaric oxygen chambers to reduce stress. Sometimes, the stress can prove fatal: In 2011, student Lü Pin committed suicide by jumping from his sixth floor dorm on the first day of the test.</p><p>Outside of changes in a student’s behavior, cities shut down during the test. Airplanes are rerouted, factories are closed, and car-horn honking is forbidden.
