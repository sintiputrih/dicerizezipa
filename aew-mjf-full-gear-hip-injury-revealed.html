In the Zero Hour pre-show, MJF would also defend his Ring of Honor Tag Team Championships, with Samoa Joe taking the place of an injured Adam Cole, in a bout against The Gunns. The match ended with The Gunns taking MJF out with a brutal attack and MJF leaving on a stretcher. It was later announced that the champion wasn't cleared to compete, so Adam Cole hobbled out to take his place, only for MJF to return at the end of the night and take White down in a heroic effort.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Say what you will about the cluttered and illogical booking, but MJF and Jay White put on a great match, including one crazy spot where, with White standing on the ring apron, MJF leaped from the ring for a cutter that sent both men crashing to the floor below. It looked incredibly painful, but with an elbow drop from the top rope to the floor, MJF hurt himself for real. He talked about popping his hip out during the match at the post-show media scrum. That wasn't MJF staying in character either, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wrestle Purists</a> reported he did indeed hurt his hip during that spot. "According to sources, MJF hurt his hip when performing an elbow drop to the outside and had to have his hip popped back in after the match. He was also said to have banged up his shoulder when taking the top rope Uranagi."</p><p>According to Wrestle Purists, MJF isn't expected to miss any time in the ring and will be good to go for AEW's next pay-per-view, World's End, in December.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Will Ospreay Is Officially All Elite, Signs Contract At Full Gear</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-mjf-in-aew>What's Next For MJF In AEW?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/collage-maker-02-nov-2023-02-46-pm-3602.jpg><p>MJF has become the face of AEW in the last year, as Tony Khan has pushed him as the company's top star after he came back from hiatus over a dispute with Khan last year. MJF is the longest reigning World Champion in AEW history and has flawlessly navigated the turn from evil heel to loved babyface thanks to his work with Adam Cole.</p><p>Many wrestlers have been coming after MJF, from Jay White and Bullet Club Gold, the mysterious Devil and their minions, his former bodyguard Wardlow, and former Ring of Honor Television Champion Samoa Joe. It looks as if Samoa Joe will be the next challenger to MJF's title at World's End on December 30, from the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York. With the PPV being held in MJF's hometown, look for him to be victorious. If MJF is going to lose to anyone, look for it to be against Swerve Strickland, who is the talk of the wrestling world following his bloody match against Hangman Page at Full Gear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>If reports are to be believed</a>, WWE thinks AEW has already quietly re-signed MJF.
