Although unlike from our last price guide, the AGP version has gone up in price about $30. The cheapest one we're seeing this week is the ATI Radeon X800XL 256MB [RTPE: <a href=#>100-435508</a>] for $278.00.</p><p>Those of you who were fortunate enough to upgrade to a PCI-E board are in luck today. The Connect3D Radeon X800XL 256MB [RTPE: <a href=#>3028C</a>] is on sale for $130.00 (after MIR -- to qualify for the $100 MIR, you must purchase a second CrossFire edition graphics card). However - if you are set on going ATI, make sure to check out our info with regard to the Connect3D X800GTO and the Sapphire X800GTO^2 on the next page.</p><p>The AGP version of the ATI X800XT 256MB All-In-Wonder [RTPE: <a href=#>100-714200</a>] is at an awesome price of $280.00 (after MIR); about a reduction of $7.00 off of its original price of $300.00 (before MIR). ATI is known for it's fantastic A-I-W cards, so if you're looking for such a creature, this may be a deal for you. However, we suggest that if you're looking for a more permanent solution, you should look into a separate PCI TV tuner card. With the relatively low cost of upgrading a tuner, and their relative longevity in terms of product cycle, an A-I-W card only makes sense if you really enjoy some of the more unique features rather than just straight hardware tuner support. By the way, don't forget that ATI has a new A-I-W launch in the next week.</p><p>For about $240, the ASUS GeForce 6800GT 256MB (PCI-E) [RTPE: <a href=#>EN6800GT/2DT/256</a>] is a super deal which has seen a price decrease of approximately $97; definitely something to consider. If you're looking to go with a SLI setup, we would recommend you look into the eVGA 7800GT we recommended on the previous page. For $140 less than two 6800GTs, you'd be able to get roughly equal performance to slightly better performance. At about the same price, a single 7800GTX will usually outperform SLI'ed 6800GTs and you have the future option of SLI.</p><p><b>With all the competitive deals right now on the ultra high end and the mid range, it makes almost no sense to buy a card in this range right now!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH55go9oaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gustav-magnar-witzoes-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Gustav Magnar Witzes net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
