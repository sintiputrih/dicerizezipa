He shared, “I’m going to be the Italian stallion in the Villa! With my Italian charm, I can also be a very romantic guy”.</p><p>The Italian handsome hunk added, “I’m good looking and I’ve realized since I first arrived in Manchester, a lot of English girls actually love me. They love to be around me and I love to be around them. It’s going to be fun, I’m looking forward to it”.</p><p>Davide has a decent motive when it comes to finding a partner. He came looking for “the one”, a soulmate with whom he could build something in the future, grow with them, and be a family.</p><p>Upon entering the show to shake things up, Davide grabbed the attention of Gemma Owen, daughter of former football star Michael Owen. When she chose to kiss Davide and revealed her age, it created tension among the viewers regarding their age difference of 8 years. Some viewers even threatened to write to Ofcom if they ever coupled up.</p><p>Indiyah also commented on Davide’s arrival saying, “When I saw him, I was very confused because I had no warning but he is very good looking!” Tasha gushed: “Straight away I was like, ‘Wow. Fit. Hot. Sexy. Hercules’”. Paige added: “I’m done. I’m ready to get married. I’m ready to have babies”.</p><p>Likewise, Davide was also thoroughly impressed by the girls on the show. The business owner said: “When I walked into the villa, I saw all the girls and I’m really impressed, I’m not going to lie”.</p><p>But this is all set to change, as Davide learned at the end of last night’s episode that he would pick a girl to couple up with.</p><h3><strong>Is Davide Sanclimenti Dating Anyone Today?</strong></h3><p>Davide Sanclimenti is mum about his current relationship status.

He added, “I prefer to be in a relationship but at the same time I don’t do a lot of dates”.</p><p>Listing the “icks”, Davide listed, “If a girl is really rude, or if she’s not giving me enough attention, I will just lose interest very quickly… If I receive nothing back, no feedback or appreciation, I will lose interest in that person”.</p><p>Speaking to Paige, Davide complimented: “I fall in love for the personality and if you have a good heart. You are a beautiful girl – you’re a good looking girl”. So, it was still unclear who he was and who he coupled with.</p><h3><strong>Davide Sanclimenti Age</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Davide Sanclimenti is 27 years old.</p><h3><strong>Davide Sanclimenti Parents</strong></h3><p>Coming to details about his parents, Davide Sanclimenti hasn’t shared any.
