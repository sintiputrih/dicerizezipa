The publication also shared that Rhodes attended the University of Alabama and received a bachelor’s degree in journalism.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>In 1991, Rhodes worked at&nbsp;The Huntsville Times&nbsp;as a political writer when Hannity, a radio host for a local station in Alabama, called her.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People magazine</a>&nbsp;reported that he tried contacting Rhodes for story ideas at the time, but that quickly shifted after he started leaving “frequent voicemails.”</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Despite the constant calls, Hannity and Rhodes wouldn’t officially meet in person until 1992 when he invited her to a mayoral debate he organized. From then on, the pair were inseparable.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>That same year, he received an offer to do a talk radio show in Atlanta, and Rhodes agreed to move with him under the condition that he would marry her. The pair would tie the knot in 1993.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>A few years later, in 1996, Hannity signed on as a co-host for Fox News’&nbsp;Hannity & Colmes, a move that ultimately catapulted his career. Later when&nbsp;Hannity & Colmes&nbsp;ended in 2009, he went on to host numerous shows for the network.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Rhodes and Hannity would also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcome two children</a>, a son, Sean Patrick Hannity, and a daughter, Merri Kelly Hannity. Throughout their union, Rhodes kept a relatively low profile while raising the duo’s children as Hannity became more and more successful. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Over Mind,</a>&nbsp;Rhodes’ occupation includes a book editor and an editor for Hannity’s Fox show.</p><h2 id=h-why-did-jill-rhodes-and-sean-hannity-divorce data-injectable=false>Why did Jill Rhodes and Sean Hannity divorce?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-27.png><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>In June 2020, Hannity and Rhodes announced in a joint statement that they were divorced, despite it being finalized the year before.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>In the statement released to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>, the former couple revealed they were “working together for the best interest of their children.”&nbsp;This appeared to be a deciding factor as to why Rhodes and Hannity didn’t address the breakup rumors when she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to accompany him at numerous Fox News events</a>. The statement read:&nbsp;</p><p>“Sean and Jill are committed to working together for the best interests of their children. Amicable agreements were entered into over four years ago between Sean and Jill. They maintain a close relationship as parents to their children. Neither will have any further comments and ask for the sake of their children that their privacy be respected.”</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>At the time this article is written, it is unclear what Rhodes, who doesn’t have any active social media accounts, does professionally now. It is also unknown whether she still is working for Hannity. Regarding her personal relationship with her ex-husband, it has been reported in the 2020 article for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> that the pair are still on friendly terms and even have family dinners.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>While it has been reported that Hannity is dating Ainsley Earhardt, a co-host on Fox & Friends, Rhodes seems to like her private life kept private.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmq5WWu260wKeloqypqHqmxIywoJ%2BdXZ%2B2rbiMq5%2BonJWofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tea-cooper-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>TeA Cooper Net Worth 2024</span></a>
