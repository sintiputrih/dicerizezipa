He's involved in one of the game's main quests, helps players with one of the major bosses, and has had the furry community in a frenzy.</p><p>Welsh voice actor Arthur admits it too. "I know that he's caused quite a stir in the furry world, which I didn't know anything about until I looked on the internet," he says at the start.</p><p>He's also keen to clear up how to pronounce the character's name: "So, you pronounce it 'Blithe'. Not Blide, not Blythe - Blithe."</p><p>And then the thirst tweets kick in.</p><p>"Blaidd is so thicc and hot," says one post. "Please make more sexy animal men, fs, please!" reads another.</p><p>"Listen, Miyazaki, that is a request," responds Arthur.</p><p>"Not only did they make Blaidd a sexy half-wolf man, they gave him a sexy voice," reads another, which Arthur bashfully reacts to. He even suggests a new version of the game where you can kiss all the characters. Who's in?</p><p>So how do all these tweets make him feel? "Warm. Aroused. Comforted. And very loved," he says. "You filthy animals."</p><p>Same, Arthur. Same.</p><p>If that isn't enough, there's a <a href=#>video</a> with Margit the Fell Omen's voice actor Anthony Howell reacting to tweets - but it's far less thirsty.</p><figure class="video_wrapper youtube"></figure><p class=section_title>Will you support Eurogamer?</p><p>We want to make Eurogamer better, and that means better for our readers - not for algorithms.
