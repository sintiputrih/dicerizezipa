He tragically passed away from a cocaine overdose on December 18, 1997, in Chicago, Illinois, at the young age of 33. Farley was recognized for his work on the Saturday Night Live show, as well as for his roles in hit films such as “Tommy Boy” and “Beverly Hills Ninja”. He was also a noteworthy stunt performer. His career spanned from 1975 to 1997.</p><h3>Early Life and Career</h3><p>Farley was the middle child of five siblings. His parents, Thomas and Mary Anne, were the owners of an oil company. After attending the Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart, he pursued a degree in Communications and Theatre at Marquette University. His first job was working for the family’s oil company, and simultaneously, he joined the Ark Improve theater group and performed live with them. Farley later moved to Chicago and became a member of the Improv Olympic Theater. He gradually honed his acting skills and ultimately became a part of the cast of the Second City Theater, catching the eye of Lorne Michaels, the producer of the TV show “Saturday Night Live”. Farley quickly joined the “SNL” cast alongside Chris Rock and later formed a sketch group called “The Bad Boys Of SNL”, which contributed significantly to his net worth.</p><h3>Career Highlights</h3><p>Aside from his work on “SNL”, Chris Farley appeared in various TV series and films. In 1992, he starred in “Wayne’s World”, alongside Mike Myers, and made an appearance in an episode of “The Jackie Thomas Show”. His career flourished in 1993 when he appeared in films like “Wayne’s World 2” and “Coneheads”. In the subsequent years, he continued to build his portfolio with “Airheads” (1994), where he portrayed Officer Wilson, and the lead role in “Tommy Boy” (1995). He also featured in films like “Black Sheep” (1996), and his most recognized role came in the 1997 film “Beverly Hills Ninja”. Before his passing, Farley took on roles in “Almost Heroes” (1998) and “Dirty Work” (1998), which proved to be his final film.</p><h3>Personal Life and Legacy</h3><p>Although there is little public information about Chris Farley’s personal life, he was a dedicated actor and comedian who unfortunately battled drug addiction, complicating an underlying heart condition. Farley’s exceptional talent was acknowledged with the Best On-Screen Duo award for his work in the film “Tommy Boy”, and he was posthumously honored with a Star on the Hollywood Boulevard in 2005.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiaoaqZqHqnrdGlnLJlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joy-behar-net-worth-the-view.html><span>←</span><span>Joy Behar Doesnt Deliver the News for Free Find Out The View Cohosts Net Worth!</span></a>
