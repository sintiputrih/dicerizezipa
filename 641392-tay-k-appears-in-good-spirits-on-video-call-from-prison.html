Tay-K was previously sentenced to 55 years in prison for his involvement in the 2016 home invasion and robbery that resulted in the death of 21-year-old Ethan Walker. He has been convicted of murder and aggravated robbery. Tay-K is best known for his 2017 hit song "<a href=# rel>The Race</a>". The single reached number 44 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It's since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</p><p>"I know bro is rethinking that decision to go on da run every hour of every day," one fan commented on a post of the new video call that was shared by NoJumper. Another argued: "He’s definitely been in there too long? How does one expect rehabilitation if u just locking up like rabbid dogs? Wasn’t he 16/17? If he getting his GED, doing good why he still in there? Can he not change his whole life around?"</p><span><h2 id=h-tay-k-s-video-call-from-prison>Tay-K's Video Call From Prison</h2></span><p>Tay-K previously pleaded for a "<a href=# rel>second chance at adulthood</a>" during a series of tweets posted back in January. “I really just need 1 chance @ adulthood,” he wrote. “I bet if I was a lil white kid they wouldn’t have gave me no 55 years for a crime I was alleged to play the most insignificant role in when I was 16….they woulda rightfully argued that my mind wasn’t fully developed and gave me rehabilitation and a 2nd (1st) chance at adulthood.”</p><p>He also referenced the 16-year-old white female co-defendant who was given 10 years probation and has since been released from prison. He added: “One of my codefendants was a white girl who was 16 jus like me…they didn’t certify her as an adult but they certified me n pimp as adults, pimp got 30, I got 55, she ended up getting 10 years of probation without no deal…that girl @ home rn.”</p><p>At the time of his initial arrest, Tay-K had just turned 17 years old. He spent a total of three months on the run beforehand. On the day that he was brought in, he released "The Race."</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaX50hZFmq5qxXaB6orzPnpirq12eu26zzqibZqugnr%2BqwNJmpqdlpp6xpruMnJilpF2bv7C5jKmpoqufow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sylvie-witsel.html><span>←</span><span>Sylvie Witsel</span></a>
