This means that not only will you have to catch every Pokémon that you can find in your individual copy of the game, but you'll also have to get the <a href=#>version exclusives</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, because some version exclusives, like <a href=#>Armarouge and Ceruledge,</a> require some assistance, it'll be best to partner with a friend who has the other game.</p><p>Once you've obtained all 400 Pokémon, you should then go to the Academy. If you've been taking your classes, then you may already be consistently checking in with Professor Jacq, the biology teacher at the Academy. Throughout the game, he'll give you various rewards for making progress in the PokéDex (because he's the one who made it).</p><p>For completing 30 entries, he'll give you the TM057 False Swipe, while 100 entries will grant you 20 Ultra Balls, and 200 will give you 20 Quick Balls.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#PokemonScarletViolet</a><br>I have Scarlet and I Just Got my Shiny Charm and the some Herba Mystica, I HAD TO GO FOR HIM FIRST! and I wound up with 2 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5KokT7fHGW</a></p>— Gerard The WereTiger (@T164Guy) <a href=#>December 31, 2022</a></figure><p>When you've found all 400 Paldean Pokémon, return to Professor Jacq in the Biology Lab and he'll give you the Shiny Charm.</p><p>"You know, I visited this strange shop the other day and happened to pick up a little something," Jacq's dialogue reads. "Might not seem like much as a secondhand gift, but here! From me to you!"</p><p>With this Shiny Charm, your odds of catching Shiny Pokémon will instantly double, becoming one in 2,048 — and you can use some of the other Shiny hunting methods available to make your Shiny spree even easier.</p><p>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are now available exclusively for the Nintendo Switch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGLAqbXNsmScoJGnum68zqScpqeeYsCkrdGlnK1lpp68rbHT</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saturday-night-live-recap-ther-html.html><span>←</span><span>Saturday Night Live Recap: Theres Something About Betty</span></a>
