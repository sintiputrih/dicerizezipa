He's given me emotional support, too; I'll never be able to thank him enough for his kindness."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/221169edfa1f-emma-samms-kitchen-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eTZBh4YveXk1x data-wc=6><strong>Emma Samms spoke exclusively to HELLO!</strong></p><p id=eKr4xrdtn22if data-wc=88>In the interview, Emma also shared some of her special memories of being in the iconic 1980s soap. When asked to recall some of her most memorable scenes from the show, she replies: "The steamy shower scene where there was no hot water and we had to film in freezing water with smoke pumped in to simulate steam. There was also that famous mud fight with Heather Locklear – I wonder why so many of the crew turned up to watch? Heather and I still laugh about that."</p><p id=eQc83lbCt4qjM data-wc=57>She also tells the magazine how she is with reuniting with her former co-stars to help raise funds for the Southmead Hospital charity to help thousands of people who, like her, are struggling with the effects of long Covid. Stephanie Beacham, Maxwell Caulfield and Heather are all taking part in the virtual event on March 20.</p><p id=ebWPzXBExk5Lr><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a06c2cbad5e5-emma-samms-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=eC1qh5_cF3wkc data-wc=8><strong>The Dynasty star at home in the Cotswolds</strong></p><p id=ePqscbq2MiZOH data-wc=36>"It's going to be fun, with lots of laughter and stories shared by the cast," she explains. "Dynasty was so great to do because it was big drama with big shoulder pads and even bigger hair."</p><p id=eIfy0pP1xHqvw data-wc=79>In the interview, Emma talks about how she first joined forces with the North Bristol NHS Trust, which is researching long Covid. "Fighting Covid-19 is at the forefront of everyone's priorities, especially mine," she says. "These doctors are stars in their field and funded by their local hospital charity trust, not the Government. I thought: 'How can I help?' The feeling of helplessness is quite overwhelming when you're unwell, so I want to raise funds to support their work."</p><p id=espXFr4he1Kzn data-wc=16><strong>Emma's fundraising Dynasty reunion takes place at 7pm on 20 March.
