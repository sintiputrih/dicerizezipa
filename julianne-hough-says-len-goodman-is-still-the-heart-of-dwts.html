His death came five months after he <a href=#>announced his DWTS retirement</a> following season 31.</p><p>Hough <a href=#>reacted to the news</a> by penning a lengthy tribute via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “The wisdom, playfulness, and class that radiated from you touched all of us with such impact,” she wrote alongside snaps of the duo over the years. “I’m forever grateful for the many years you influenced my past, present and future! What an honor it has been to have been a part of your wonderful life. You’re a legend and left a beautiful legacy. I love you forever.”</p><p>While DWTS bid farewell to Goodman, the show welcomed back former <a href=#>season 19 champion</a> and <a href=#>season 31 cohost</a> <a href=#><strong>Alfonso Ribeiro</strong></a>. “I am beyond thrilled to be hosting alongside Alfonso,” Hough told Us of their partnership. “We’ve been friends for over 10 years and <a href=#>have great chemistry as cohosts</a>. It’s such a joy to be back in the ballroom, and we’re so excited for all that is to come this season! This is a full circle moment for me, and the show is where I feel most at home.”</p><p>Fans can expect many more “show-stopping performances” this season, Hough teased. “We have <a href=#>a fabulous cast</a> who all have incredible stories to share, and I can’t wait for the fans to follow along with their journeys,” she added. “The time and energy the cast puts into this show is impressive – it requires hours and hours of rehearsing and preparing. It is no small feat learning a new dance every week!”</p><p>In addition to her DWTS hosting duties, Hough recently teamed up with the female-led beverage company Blender Bites as a brand partner and investor. “They are truly revolutionizing the frozen category with their award-winning <a href=#>1-Step Smoothies</a> and 1-Step Frappes which are full of healthy, functional ingredients and are absolutely delicious!” she shared. “They are my go-to solution and keep me fueled when trying to manage my busy schedule and not having to compromise on my nutrition.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Julianne-Hough-Says-Len-Goodman-Is-Still-The-Heart-of-DWTS-Over-5-Months-After-His-Death2.jpg><p>The drinks are perfect for people with active lifestyles and those looking to adopt healthy habits. “Working out and staying healthy has always been a part of my life and daily routine,” Hough said of <a href=#>her fitness routine</a>. “I started dancing at a young age, so maintaining a healthy diet and incorporating a workout into my day has always been valuable to me. I move my body every day doing a variety of workouts, which helps maintain my physical and mental energy. It is all about balance!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Blender Bites are now available at Walmart Supercenter stores across the country, as well as online at Walmart.com.
