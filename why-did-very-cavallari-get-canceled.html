Here’s some insight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@KristenCavallari</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was Kristin Cavallari‘s reality TV show 'Very Cavallari' canceled?</h2><p>Fans of Kristin were understandably disappointed by the news of Very Cavallari's cancellation. Kristin herself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed on Instagram</a> that the show wouldn’t be getting another season and that it was her decision to end it. The cancellation of the show was announced about a month after she revealed that she was leaving her husband, <a href=#>Jay Cutler</a>. They had been together for about a decade.</p><p>The caption on Kristin's show cancellation announcement Instagram said, “As I start this new chapter in my life, I have decided not to continue with Very Cavallari. I’ve absolutely loved my time filming and am so grateful to E! Entertainment for making this journey possible. To the fans: I can’t thank you enough for all your support and for keeping up with me all of these years. I love you guys.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Fans in the comment section were quick to talk about their heartbreak. One fan wrote, “I am literally just seeing this now and I am so sad! I was not a big fan of you on Laguna Beach or The Hills, but my opinion of you changed as soon as I started watching your show. Thank you for sharing another little piece of your life with us again, Kristin.”</p><p>Although Kristin didn’t specify the reason why she didn’t want to return for another season of Very Cavallari, she made it clear that she didn’t want to continue filming.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/@TGroupProductions</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did the cancellation of 'Very Cavallari' have anything to do with Kristin Cavallari's split from Jay Cutler?</h2><p>A lot of people have jumped to the assumption that Kristin decided to stop filming the show because her marriage was coming to an end.</p><p>Kristin and Jay posted a joint statement <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram saying</a>, “We have nothing but love and respect for one another and are deeply grateful for the years shared, memories made, and the children we are so proud of. This is just the situation of two people growing apart. We ask everyone to respect our privacy as we navigate this difficult time within our family."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kristin Cavallari (@kristincavallari)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@KristenCavallari</a></figure><p>The relationship initially appeared to have ended on somewhat amicable terms, although Jay did enjoy a divorce settlement party with his friends after everything was finalized.</p><p>In an episode of his podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncut With Jay Cutler</a>, he said, “When the settlement came through, I threw a party. I don’t recommend divorce for anybody. I’m just going to go ahead and say that, but it worked out. It worked out for Kristin. It worked out for me. So it is what it is."</p><p>As of now, it’s unclear if the show’s ending was directly connected to their split.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aulafGbq%2FAr5ilpJGntm6zxK1knJmemLKtscM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roasted-squash-apple-salsa.html><span>←</span><span>Roasted Squash with Apple Salsa</span></a>
