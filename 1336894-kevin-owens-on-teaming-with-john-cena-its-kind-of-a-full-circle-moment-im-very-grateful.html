When asked about teaming up with John Cena on SmackDown to face Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn, KO said he considers it a full circle moment from how his <a href=#>WWE</a> career began.</p><p>“So I started my year out not really expecting any of that for sure. The match with Steve [Austin] at WrestleMania is, you know, it really doesn’t get any higher than that in terms of career moment,” Kevin Owens said. “And then, like you say, closing out the year with teaming with John Cena. It’s kind of a full circle with the way I started my WWE career, and now I’m getting to do that with him as he’s obviously here less and less, and one of the reasons he’s coming is because he wants to make sure he has one match in this calendar year, so history doesn’t get broken because he’s had a match every single year for the last twenty years, at least one match.</p><p>“So it’s just so great to get to experience all that stuff. I’ve been very lucky and fortunate to be in the ring with people I looked up to as I was coming up, and 99% of them have been amazing, and it’s been so great to be around them and kind of getting to see that the people I looked up to, as great as they seem to be on television and John’s at the top of that list, man. The moment I showed up, he was all about trying to help me be the best performer I could be and as valuable to WWE as I could get. And now, to get the team with him as his matches, let alone his appearances, are few and far between. But as matches are even more rare. It’s just — I’m very grateful to get into all that.”</p><p>What do you make of Kevin Owens’ comments? Are you looking forward to his tag team match with John Cena on WWE SmackDown?
