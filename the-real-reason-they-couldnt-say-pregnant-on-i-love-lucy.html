Though many cite "I Love Lucy" as having the first pregnancy story on television, that honor goes to "Mary&nbsp;Kay & Johnny," back in 1948; however, the popularity and influence of "I Love Lucy" was much more significant, so much so that a priest, minister, and rabbi were called in, not to form the punchline of a joke but rather supervise the script to see if it was offensive.
