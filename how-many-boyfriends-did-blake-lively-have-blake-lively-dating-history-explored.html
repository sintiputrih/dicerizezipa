In addition to their previous collaborations, Lively and Blatz appeared in the horror/thriller movie “Simon Says” in 2006.</p><h2 class=if><strong class=cf>Penn Dayton Badgley</strong></h2><p>Initially linked only as acquaintances, Penn Dayton Badgley Lively and Penn Dayton Badgley were first reported dating in 2007. A year later, the “Gossip Girl” co-stars visited the Met Gala together and officially announced their relationship.</p><p>Even though the pair walked down the aisle on-screen, their relationship was short-lived in real life, and the duo barely made it through “Gossip Girl” season two. The actors reportedly called it quits on their romance midway through the season but kept it a secret from the other cast members.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Penn Badgley (@pennbadgley)</a></p><p>They have lively discussed her off-screen courtship with Badgley and their choice to stay friends after breaking up in an interview. Despite the attention paid to their lives, they maintained a low profile, especially at the start and conclusion of their relationship.</p><p>They claimed to be friends when they first started dating because they worried their relationship would interfere with their jobs. However, they soon discovered their superiors wanted them to date because it was necessary for the plot. The couple split up in 2010 after three years of dating but didn’t let it impact their careers.</p><p>They kept quiet about the breakup because they wanted their personal and professional lives separate. Joshua Safran, the co-producer and writer of the show, admitted that he was taken aback to learn that Lively and Badgley had split up months earlier while filming the season two conclusion.</p><p>Safran was still taken aback by Lively and Badgley’s decision to keep their breakup a secret from the cast and staff to prevent any adverse effects on the show. He was also amazed by their acting abilities, particularly considering how they pretended to be dating for the following four seasons.</p><h3 class=jf><strong class=cf>The same year Lively and Badgley broke up, Ryan and Johansson released a joint statement confirming they were getting a divorce.</strong></h3><h2>&nbsp;Ryan Gosling</h2><p>When they were seen having ice cream together at Disneyland soon after Lively’s spit from Badgley in October 2010, Lively and Gosling sparked dating rumors.

Hence, she had to identify herself to the security officer before she was allowed to meet Gosling.</p><p>People started noticing the couple growing close, which made them the center of attention. While Lively looked at him with smoldering eyes, Gosling tenderly touched her leg.

The two were visible in public for the second occasion at this time. None of their publicists replied when asked about the situation.</p><p>However, Gosling’s buddy claimed that although they had gone out on several occasions and were interested in one another, he didn’t believe they were dating seriously. He continued that Lively and Gosling were only courting on a casual basis, but he could see it developing. The dating reports eventually stopped.</p><h2 class=if><strong class=cf>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h2><p>Even though it only lasted a few months, Lively’s romance with renowned actor Leonardo DiCaprio garnered media attention.
