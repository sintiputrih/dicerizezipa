At the time, she lost all hope and began drinking alcohol to lessen the pain of losing her child. However, Jeremy Ivey gave his wife all the love and support he could provide. The thought of her surviving son, Judah Quinn, gave Margo some bit of hope.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I don’t post many photos of my son because I want to protect him and I respect his privacy but there is nothin more important to me in this whole wide world than him. ❤ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xVWxMoZ540</a></p><p>— Margo Price (@MissMargoPrice) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2018</a></p><p>As such, Judah is the reason for his mother’s well-being.
