The couple have worked on music together and frequently performed, but it wasn’t until June that they were photographed in Miami holding hands at the Kaseya Center. In September 2023, they were seen again <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hola.com/us/celebrities/20230908350132/karol-g-feid-nyc-date/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="holding hands in New York City" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">holding hands in New York City</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Here’s everything to know about Karol G’s boyfriend Feid.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">Who is musical artist Feid?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The musician’s birth name is Salomón Villada Hoyos, though he goes by Feid as a stage name that came from the phrase “Faith in God and in himself.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Feid was born in Medellín, Colombia, in 1992, the son of a university professor and a psychologist. He eventually took music courses at the University of Antioquia and began focusing on learning to play a number of instruments, including the piano and guitar. He was particularly in love with reggaeton music.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">He began as a songwriter, penning “Ginza,” and “Sigo Extrañándote” for J Balvin. He has also collaborated with Maluma, Nicky Jam, and Sebastian Yatra. His first solo album Morena came out in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Fied told <a href=# title="El Tiempo" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-16517022 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="El Tiempo" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">El Tiempo</a> in an interview, “Going from being a composer to being an artist is something different, I do it with more passion and love. Music is really what moves me every day to get up, to go to bed, to have lunch; in everything.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">His next album Feliz Cumpleaños Ferxxo got him into the top 10 for Billboard’s Top Latin Albums chart by its second week. Soon after, he started a two-week tour in the U.S. that sold out in 24 hours, and then made history by selling out two dates at the Puerto Rico coliseum in an hour and a half.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">How long have Feid and Karol G been together?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The pair released a song title “Friki” in 2021, which sparked dating rumors, but they have been friends for a number of years. The video for the song was pretty sexy, though:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">They initially denied rumors of anything more than friendship. In May 2022, Feid told a reporter, “If I had something to say, I’d let everyone know, but I don’t have anything to share...We made a song, I was with her on tour, I love her a lot and everything, but there is nothing beyond that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">However, as early as March 2023, fans interpreted some of Karol G’s behavior on stage as a confirmation they were in a relationship. At the Estadio Hiram Bithorn in Puerto Rico, Feid performed “Friki” with his girlfriend, and then she made a surprise announcement. The star said that the love song “Tus Gafitas” on her album Mañana Será Bonito was written about Feid, announcing just before she sang it, “This song is for Feid!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The song is about someone going through a heartbreaking end of a relationship and then meeting someone who encourages them to love again. Karol G had a pretty public breakup with her ex-boyfriend Anuel AA in 2021 after three years together. But she loves again.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">They've been seen out together on a date as recently as Sept. 7, 2023.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The couple had a rare public moment while spending time in New York City in early September. They held hands while fans offered gifts to them:</p><img alt="celebrity sightings in new york city september 07, 2023" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - September 07, 2023" width=1997 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/feid-and-karol-g-are-seen-on-september-07-2023-in-new-york-news-photo-1694195326.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Raymond Hall</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="celebrity sightings in new york september 07, 2023" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York - September 07, 2023" width=3100 height=2013 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/feid-and-karol-g-are-seen-on-september-07-2023-in-new-york-news-photo-1698260941.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prjLnmWcp51ksLa4066pnmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SudYGPbmdpa2lkxKm7jKKqZqORp7ytecZmmaixlqe2prrDZp2eoZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jude-ciccolella-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jude Ciccolella Net Worth</span></a>
