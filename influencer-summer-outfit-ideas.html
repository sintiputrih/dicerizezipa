After all, following a weekend of mini skirts, crop tops, and bodycon dresses, there's simply no turning back once it's over.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>complaints around the event</a> have since surfaced online, with some influencers sharing stories of disorganization, others have said they had a different experience — one filled with beauty and fashion activations, refreshments from Erewhon, and performances from artists like Jack Harlow and Migos. InStyle was also in attendance, catching up with some of the biggest names in the entertainment and fashion industries, and getting the inside scoop on what they can't wait to wear this summer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We gathered their best summer outfit ideas, 2022 trends, and fashion tips, ahead — all of which will surely handy in the near future.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-peyton-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Peyton List</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BFA</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Actress Peyton List arrived at Revolve Festival in pastel purple eye makeup, which really popped against her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>trendy yet simplistic white outfit</a>.</p><p>"I feel like there is such a different style depending on what city you're in," the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Pley Beauty</a> founder told InStyle when discussing her summer fashion choices. "Whenever I travel for work, I end up becoming a different girl. When I'm in Los Angeles, I love long, flowy dresses, just because it's like, 100 degrees there."</p><p>List said that she reaches for options from LoveShackFancy and Zimmerman, and added that pants are also part of her summer rotation.</p><p>"I also love high waisted linen pants," she said. "Anything that's not too tight."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rickey-thompson></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rickey Thompson</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BFA</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This year, I really wanted to go for something chill and fashionable," mega-influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rickey Thompson</a> told us when speaking about his look. In this case, "chill" meant a black leather jacket by Noid, featuring unapologetically bold shoulders, along with matching split-hem pants with lace up details and silver hardware.</p><p>While the statement look isn't what most would throw on for a low-effort day, it is right in line with Thompson's vibe for the upcoming season, which includes all-black ensembles and a lot of Rick Owens, all with risque attributes.</p><p>"The summer is giving no clothes, honestly," Thompson said with a laugh. "Shorts, cutouts — I just want to show the body."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-karrueche-tran></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Karrueche Tran</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BFA</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're compiling a list of style stars to watch, actress and model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Karrueche Tran</a> should be at the top. Known for rocking everything from new, cutting-edge to designers to major 'It' brands of the moment (Ambush, Ottolinge, and Miaou are some the Daytime Emmy winner's favorites), every outfit includes exciting elements — much like the chunky, steel-toed boots that completed Tran's festival look.</p><p>"I have fun mixing different textures and different styles, and I'm all about being sexy and comfortable," she told InStyle about her fashion choices. "I like corsets with baggy jeans or a mini skirt, and a lot of DIY — taking something like a white tank and cropping it."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-remi-bader></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Remi Bader</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Remi Bader</a>, comfort is a must when it comes to summer outfits — which is likely why the TikTok sensation spent the weekend in sneakers, pairing them with a sheer maxi dress (above) and a mesh set, both from Camila Coelho</p><p>"I'm not throwing on heels or heeled combat boots just to look cool. It's not happening," said Bader. She also told InStyle that, while many may be waiting for the green light to hop into a pair of jean shorts, she would rather avoid them (Bader said she only feels comfortable in jean shorts from a small number of brands, such as Good American).</p><p>"Even in the summer, I'll wear long jeans — probably baggy ones with a crop top and cute mules," she said. Even still, Bader, who is launching her own Remi x Revolve collection, does have plans to rock a specific color this season. Right now, she's all about accents in any shade of green — think heels, a handbag, or a lightweight blazer.</p><p><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>RELATED: TikTok Fashion Star Remi Bader Just Landed a Cool New Job With Victoria's Secret Pink</a></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-olivia-culpo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Olivia Culpo</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BFA</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By colorblocking her bright green, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Amanda Uprichard</a> skirt with a bright orange bag, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Olivia Culpo</a> stood out in the crowd at Revolve's event.
