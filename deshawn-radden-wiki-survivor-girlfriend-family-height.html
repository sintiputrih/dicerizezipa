Then, joining into details, Deshawn explained why he believes he can win Survivor. He said it’s because he is self-aware, analytical enough to pick up on social cues, and smart enough to critically think through obstacles that may present themselves, without becoming flustered. He also gushed:</p><p>“I am physically enough…, but also, cunning enough to get any physical threats… persuasive but non-threatening. I have street smarts and book smarts and am empathetic enough to be read as trustworthy”</p><p>In the meantime, he wants to model his gameplay off of a few former Survivor players.</p><p>Talking to Parade in September 2021, Deshawnshared that he identifies with Cirie Fields the most as a non-winner and Wendell Holland as a winner of the most. Also, to their “What do you think people will perceive you as?”, Deshawn answered with an “I assume that people will perceive me as a very likable guy.”</p><p>He added, during his time on Survivor&nbsp;he would want his alliance partner to be loyal, a bit level-headed, and a bit predictable.</p><h3><strong>Deshawn Radden Age</strong></h3><p>When Survivor 41 premiered on CBS on 10 November 2021, Deshawn Radden had already celebrated his 26th birthday.</p><h3><strong>What Medical School Does Deshawn Radden Go To?</strong></h3><p>Deshawn Radden who is from San Bernardino, California is now based in Miami, Florida for his medical school.

Even if he had one, he did not care to open up on his CBS bio or his social media.</p><p>His social media sharing so far is especially devoid of dating life and relationship cues. He posted a few snapshots of his life as a medical student before changing the entire focus to his time on Survivor.</p><h3><strong>Deshawn Radden Family</strong></h3><p>Deshawn is one of five children. When asked “Who is your hero?” in his CBS bio, he revealed that his heroes are his parents. Why? He explained both his parents “truly” took parenting personally.

That can be hard to come by these days.”</p><p>So, every time Deshawn gets a chance he makes sure to chime in such good intentions and credit his parents for all they have done for him and his four siblings.</p><p>Deshawn’s dad Dwaine Radden Sr. is the executive director of PAL Charter Academy High School, a WASC Accredited charter school that has been servicing high school students throughout the Inland Empire.</p><p>Also, we came to know, that his older brother McArthur Deshawn, who continues to live in Johnson City, Tennessee, is his half-brother.
