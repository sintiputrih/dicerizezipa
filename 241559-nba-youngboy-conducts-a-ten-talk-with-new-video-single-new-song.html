The superstar follows a similar formula in this one, mixing melodics with street savviness and piecing it all together with a low-budget clip. Proving that he still dominates the internet, the video has picked up over one million views since it debuted a few hours ago.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I can't take the clean route, I'm G'd up<br>They talk down, I'm rich now, lil' n***a, I can head home<br>Fresh up outta cell block and fill up an arena<br>I'm turnt up, you try and get your face blown</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiaX52gZhmpZuZXa68trrGm6ayZZOku6XBwq2qZpldqbKvedOao6Rlp57BqXnNnq5mrpmZsrB50qKloKSVYrumw4yspqef</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./my-600-lb-life-who-was-matthew-ventress-death-cause-suicide-or-accident.html><span>←</span><span>My 600 LB Life: Who Was Matthew Ventress?
