As of 2023, Tom Holland’s net worth is $25 million. He accumulated his net worth by acting in high-profile films. For example, Tom was paid $250,000 to appear very briefly on&nbsp;“Captain America: Civil War”.</p><p>Tom Holland’s parents are Nicola Frost and Dominic Holland. They both work creative jobs; Nicola is a photographer, and Dominic is a comedian and author. When he was nine, Nicola saw Tom dancing to a Janet Jackson song and realized he had great potential. She enrolled him in dancing classes, where he was spotted by the choreographer for&nbsp;“Billy Elliot the Musical”.&nbsp;Two years of acrobatics, gymnastics, and tap-dancing lessons later, Holland finally landed the role of the play’s protagonist, which is how his career started.</p><p>However, he gained real popularity when he signed the deal with MCU for the role of Spider-Man. His name was entered in the Guinness Book of World record for being the youngest actor to act as the title character in an MCU movie.</p><p>He’s experimented well out of his range in movies like&nbsp;The Devil All the Time&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cherry.
