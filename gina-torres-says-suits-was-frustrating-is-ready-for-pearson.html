What’s so beautiful about being able to revisit Jessica in this setting and in this way is, it’s a walk through all those doors that just weren’t open while we were doing Suits,”&nbsp;Torres, 50, told Us Weekly exclusively.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She added that this means seeing “more of the woman” behind those powerful and stunning suits.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“We will get to meet her family. You know she wasn’t just hatched from an egg and then plugged in to this corner office. There’s life there.

Woodside</strong>.</p><p>“They are together, they are in love and they remain very different people,” the Firefly alum said. “That presents its own set of challenges. If anybody’s ever been in a relationship with somebody that you just adore and can’t be around or just try to navigate, [you ask], ‘As much as you love this person, is this person my person? Is this person good for me?’ All of those things come in to play. Are we really on the same side and if we are, why are our perspectives so different?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for their future, Torres noted, “Anything’s possible.”</p><p>Pearson premieres Wednesday, July 17, at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6ippFiwbC%2B0Z6qZquRrsBuv9Siq6xlp5bAbrLRrqqtqpGptq%2BzjKKqZqqVlrG6ecWoqWaolZa%2FtLvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./krishan-kumar-modi.html><span>←</span><span>Krishan Kumar Modi</span></a>
