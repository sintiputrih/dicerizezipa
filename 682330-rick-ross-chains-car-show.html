Is a lot of that conversation due to his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">feud</a> with fellow car show host DJ Envy, as they've sent each other shots back and forth? Well, yes, but well before that, Rozay made it clear that he would put on an opulent and lavish event for his community. In fact, he made that all the more clear with his latest Instagram promotion, where he revealed over $300,000 in gold and diamond chains as prizes for the event's winners. Moreover, categories include "Best Car," "Best Bike," "Hustler Of The Year," and many more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fortunately for the Promise Land's host, previous obstacles that could've prevented the celebration from taking place resolved themselves shortly after they came up. For example, local officials originally did not give Rick Ross an official permit to be able to host the car show. However, earlier this week, the Biggest Boss confirmed that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">they gave him the all-clear</a> on his Instagram page. As such, now the stage is set for his event to thrive, and the battleground with him and DJ Envy on each side has a clear view between them.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rick-ross-shows-off-his-car-show-prizes-over-300-000-in-chains>Rick Ross Shows Off His Car Show Prizes: Over $300,000 In Chains</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, there are plenty of people out there who think that beef has gone too far, including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Fat Joe</a>. “<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Don’t like</a> what’s going on with&nbsp;Rick Ross&nbsp;and DJ Envy,” the New York rap icon said in an IG video. “Don’t like it. I love ’em both. Beautiful men in their own right, successful, do their thing. I don’t like where it’s going. I know I’ve had my share of beefing with people, but I don’t like it because they’re both beautiful, beautiful people."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, this weekend will see the first stage of this "showdown," with Envy's show in Memphis (in benefit of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Dolph</a>'s family) taking place on Sunday, May 28. On the other hand, the MMG mogul will host his event at his Promise Land estate in Fayetteville, Georgia on Saturday, June 3. If one of those chains catches your eye, or what DJ Envy is offering, then you better find yourself a nice whip soon. Regardless, check back in with HNHH for the latest news and updates on DJ Envy, Rick Ross, and their car shows.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbX90f49mqaKbm2K%2FsL%2FSZpqhmZmjwG6vwKtkrKCfrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-duckett-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Rick Duckett Cause of Death</span></a>
