The 35-year-old actress got her big break in Hollywood starring in the sci-fi series <i>Dark Angel</i> in 2000, and she soon began covering magazines.</p><p>“My sexuality made me very uncomfortable,” she said. “I remember my first <i>Maxim</i> shoot, they were telling me to pose a certain way, and I was like, ‘Agh! I’m 19. I’m a virgin. I don’t even know how to do that.’ It was so awkward.” In the <a href=#>2000 spread</a> for the men’s magazine, Alba showed off her curves in a black bra under a totally sheer top.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Jessica Alba" width=620 height=843 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>As a tomboy growing up, the </span><i>Sin City</i><span> star wasn’t totally comfortable with her newfound sultry image. “I was into wearing Triple Five Soul baggy cargo pants. I would get Hanes tank tops and dye them with Rit dye and wear Nike sports bras and sweatshirts. It was the opposite of sexy,” she said.</span></p><p>“The first time I wore a dress and heels, I had to go to the Golden Globes — I was nominated for <i>Dark Angel</i>,” she recalled. “I took my brother. I was so worried about not looking like a lady. I remember thinking, ‘I hope I don’t trip.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>By the time she was 25, she had played an exotic dancer in</span><i> Sin City a</i><span>nd a bikini-clad diver in</span><i> Into the Blue</i><span>. “I sort of went through a life crisis,” she told </span><i>InStyle</i><span>. “I was like, ‘This isn’t what I set out to be. I’m so much more than this, but I don’t know how not to be a sex symbol.'”</span></p><p>Ten years later, the beauty is the founder of a billion-dollar business, The Honest Company, which makes safe, eco-friendly products for both children and adults at affordable prices. She’s also mom to two daughters, Honor, 7, and Haven, 4, with her husband,&nbsp;<b>Cash Warren</b>. “It was not planned, but I was like, ‘OK, this is where my life is going,’” she said of finding out she was pregnant at age 26. “I always wanted to be a mom.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaOotqStjJqjm5ldnnq4rdJmmGaumae0qrqMsJ%2Bepl2eerG70p6bZp6fp3q0sdeyZKaZqJ66bq%2FOr5yrZadnfXmDlW9m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Lopez News - Us Weekly</span></a>
