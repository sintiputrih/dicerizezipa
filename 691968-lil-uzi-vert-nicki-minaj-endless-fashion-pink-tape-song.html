Still, even if you aren't the biggest fan of the project, you can't deny that songs like "Endless Fashion," featuring <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>, are clear highlights. On the bouncy and bright cut, the two MCs trade ridiculous bars, clever wordplay, and of course, plenty of flexes of their luxury fashion sense. In addition, it's all brought together by a cheeky and instantly recognizable vocal interpolation of Eiffel 65's "Blue (Da Ba Dee)."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">First, the production on the track is relatively atmospheric, with minimal hi-hats, snares, and kicks making up the drum pattern. In addition, there's not a strong or super prominent melody in the instrumentation, as Lil Uzi Vert and Nicki Minaj take up that responsibility vocally. Instead, the beat is grounded by occasional high-pitched synth keys and by washed-out and faint synth pads replicating the catchy tune of "Blue." As such, it makes for quite the dreamy and spacey cut that doesn't take itself too seriously, but ensures that the vibe of the track goes further than its novelty. What's more is that both artists come through with some sharp bars and melodic phrases to fill the track up, especially Nicki.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-uzi-vert-nicki-minaj-s-endless-fashion>Lil Uzi Vert & Nicki Minaj's "Endless Fashion"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In fact, she and JT spoke on Twitter about the process behind her verse, with the City Girl asking <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">how she turned it in so fast</a>. "Girl I started @ 8am & finished like 5pm,” the Queen explained. “When I tell you I was exhausted by the time I was done. Lol. B/c I was rushing to get it in on time. I kept telling [them] ’30 mins’ then hitting [them] back 2 hours later TB 15-20 more minutes Uzi!!!! I did that ALL DAY LONG YO." Even Natalie Nunn reacted to the Queen name-dropping her in this verse, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">showing her love</a>.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbn56gpdmo6KkXarHqnnVnqmtZZ6esKy1jKagp5maYrKvsMueqqxllpbAqbXOp2SpoZ6gerWtz55krKeenA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juneteenth-social-media-campaign-hellajuneteenth.html><span>←</span><span>How a Viral Hashtag Made Juneteenth a Holiday for Millions</span></a>
