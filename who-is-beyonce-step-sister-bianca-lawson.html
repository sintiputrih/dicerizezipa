Bianca's breakout role came in 1993 when she starred as part of the main cast of Saved by the Bell: The New Class. Following on from this early role, she starred in popular dramas such as <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></strong>, Dawson's Creek, and Bones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/34a47b265559-beyonce-step-sister-bianca-lawson-1.jpg><p id=eQA4P4gWJW89 data-wc=49>In 2009, Bianca joined the cast of the much-loved teen mystery series <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Pretty Little Liars</a></strong>.

The 41-year-old grew up with one sister, fellow singer-songwriter <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Solange Knowles</a></strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/dfd40c2ea8ea-beyonce-step-sister-bianca-lawson-7.jpg><p id=e6Ao8OKH_9I4 data-wc=43>But while the 'Crazy in Love' star has only one biological sibling, since her mom's remarriage she now technically has two sisters, the other being her step-sister Bianca.
