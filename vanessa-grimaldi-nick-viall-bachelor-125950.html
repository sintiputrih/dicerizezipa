Last night, shortly after The Bachelor saw four emotional — and very different — hometown dates, Vanessa Grimaldi (one of the final four ladies) took to Instagram to remind everyone what a cute couple she and Nick Viall make!

Before Vanessa’s father gave his blessing, he asked Nick if he asked the same thing of other fathers — and the Bachelorette alum eventually confessed that he did.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: ‘The Bachelor’ Winner’s Family Has Serious Concerns About Nick Viall</a></p><p>While this was hard for Mr. Grimaldi to hear, it was even harder for him to tell Vanessa, who apparently hadn’t considered the possibility that there are other women in the running — and she’s not the only serious relationship Nick is in (despite, you know, only knowing him for six weeks…).</p><p>After learning from her dad that Nick “likes other people,” V was clearly heartbroken and decided that she needed to talk to Nick — though the episode ended on a cliffhanger when it was his ex <strong>Andi Dorfman</strong> that knocked on his door — not the Montreal native.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nick-viall-vanessa-grimaldi.jpg><p>But with this emotional post on Instagram, Vanessa reminds us that she clearly still has feelings for Nick — and she’s very much still in the running.</p><p>Last night’s episode proved how close she is with her family — interestingly enough, it was Nick’s hometown on Andi’s season that sold her on the Wisconsin native (<a href=#>who has 10 siblings</a>).</p><p>“I saw him on Andi’s season when they went to his family’s house for the hometown date, and I just fell in love with how close he is to his family,” she previously confessed to <a href=#>Glamour</a>. “I come from a very traditional Italian family, and I’m very close to mine. He seems real. It was so tempting to research and find out stuff about him before the show, but I told myself, ‘I’m coming in on a clean slate, so it’s only fair that I do the same for him.’”</p><p>Looks like she also neglected to brush up on the show — like, you know, that part that states that he’s going to date (and possibly even fall for) multiple women at once…</p><p><a href=#><strong>Curious who wins it all?
