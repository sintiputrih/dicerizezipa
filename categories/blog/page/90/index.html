Pink Tape is finally here, and odds are that you like at least one of Lil Uzi Vert's 26 tracks on it (although fan consensus indicates that people are mostly enjoying a big chunk of the tracklist). Still, even if you aren't the biggest fan of the project, you can't deny that songs like "Endless Fashion," featuring Nicki Minaj, are clear highlights. On the bouncy and bright cut, the two MCs trade ridiculous bars, clever wordplay, and of course, plenty of flexes of their luxury fashion sense.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Linda Zelkowitz Obituary (1948 - 2022) - Pittsburgh, PA</h2><time>May 25, 2024</time>

In a new interview with&nbsp;Rolling Stone (where she once interned) to promote an upcoming HBO documentary about her dad ‚Äî which she executive-produced ‚Äî Frances Bean is doing just that: speaking openly about Nirvana, how it feels to be compared to Kurt, and her rocky relationship with her mother.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Skyler Gisondo Still Dating Girlfriend Ari Haagen?
