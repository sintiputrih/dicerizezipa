<a href=../../../../newport.html></a>
Newport was founded in 1639 by a group of settlers who came to Rhode Island (Aquidneck Island at the time) to pursue religious beliefs that they weren’t allowed to practice in secular Boston. Livelihoods in Newport during the time were built off of trade and export businesses (mostly centered on candles, fish, furniture, rum, and silver) made profitable by the easy access to Newport harbor.
During the Revolutionary War, Newport became a hotbed for promoting independence and as a result, the British occupied the town from 1776 to 1779.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Robert Irvine Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</h2><time>Jul 23, 2024</time>
