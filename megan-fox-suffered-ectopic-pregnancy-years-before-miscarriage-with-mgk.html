<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Megan Fox Suffered Ectopic Pregnancy Years Before Miscarriage With MGK</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a> has gotten candid about her past fertility struggles.</p><p class=p1>“That experience [of suffering a miscarriage] was so much harder than I would’ve anticipated it being, and I’ve really analyzed, ‘Why was that? Why was that so difficult for me?’” Fox, 37, told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Women’s Wear Daily </i></a>in an interview published on Wednesday, November 29. “Because when I was younger, I had an ectopic pregnancy, I’ve had other things that I’m not going to say, because God forbid the world will be in an uproar.”</p><p class=p1>The actress did not further elaborate on her ectopic pregnancy, which occurs when a fetus grows outside the womb (usually in a fallopian tube instead of the uterus). The fetus is unable to survive outside of the uterus, resulting in a pregnancy loss.</p><p class=p1>Fox recently revealed in her <i>Pretty Boys Are Poisonous </i>poetry book that <a href=#>she privately dealt with a miscarriage</a> amid her romance with <strong>Machine Gun Kelly.</strong> (Fox and the rapper, 33, have been together since 2020.)</p><p class=p1>“I’ve been through other similar issues, but not with someone who I was so in love with,” Fox told <i>WWD</i>, praising Kelly’s support. “And so that love element really made this miscarriage really tragic for me and left me with a lot of grief and a lot of suffering.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Megan-Fox-Previously-Suffered-Ectopic-Pregnancy-Prior-to-Miscarriage-With-Machine-Gun-Kelly-2.jpg><p class=p1>She continued: “So I <a href=#>put it into a lot of writing</a>. He’s written about them in his albums as well, he wrote a couple of songs about the miscarriage. So it just felt like something that I could address publicly because it’s been addressed in one way through him, so I have a space to express as well.”</p><p class=p1>Fox and Kelly (real name Colson Baker) each have children from past relationships. Fox shares three kids — Noah, 11, Bodhi, 9, and Journey, 7 — with ex-husband <strong>Brian Austin Green</strong>. Kelly, meanwhile, is the father of 14-year-old daughter Casie, whom he shares with ex <strong>Emma Cannon</strong>.</p><p class=p1>Earlier this month, Fox noted in a <i>Good Morning America </i>interview<i> </i>that her miscarriage was unlike anything she had experienced “before in [her] life.”</p><p class=p1>“I have three kids, so it was very difficult for both of us, and it sent us on a very wild journey together and separately and together and apart … trying to navigate, ‘What does this mean?’ and ‘Why did this happen?’” Fox explained.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>According to Fox, it was Kelly who inspired her <a href=#>to write a poetry book</a> and share their miscarriage story. “I just think it was something inside of me that had to come out, because it was going to make me sick,” she added.</p><p class=p1>Kelly proposed to Fox in 2022 before <a href=#>they hit a rough patch</a> earlier this year. After a blowout argument at a Super Bowl party in February, they ceased planning their wedding. A source <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>in October</a> that they are focused on “feeling solid” in their relationship before diving back into wedding plans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZeWu26yzrFkrK2Wm7KzscNmnJysn6W2pHnPq5ygppGjsLp52J6Yq6tdl7Knu9GeZKaho5ius77Imp6eZaeewal5zKCiaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeon-yeo-been.html><span>←</span><span>Jeon Yeo-been</span></a>
