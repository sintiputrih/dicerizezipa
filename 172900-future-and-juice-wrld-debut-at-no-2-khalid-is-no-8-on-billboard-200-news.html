<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Future &amp;amp; Juice WRLD Debut At No. 2; Khalid Is No. 8 On Billboard 200</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/cover/30/17/1540761730_3f4723643fb79906433054ffda76b3c9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This week, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Juice WRLD</a> have made their collaborative debut on the Billboard 200 Albums chart with WRLD ON DRUGS going No. 2 across all genres after earning 98,000 units, with 8,000 of those coming from pure album sales.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Naturally, streaming was the name of the numbers game for the duo as they racked up a recorded&nbsp;123.4 million on-demand audio streams in the first set, making it the most-streamed album of the week. This signals&nbsp;toward the second&nbsp;top-five charting project for both Future and Juice. Previously, Future went to No. 3 for his Beastmode 2 project, which was catapulted to the top off of streaming alone while Juice WRLD&nbsp;enjoyed a peak at No. 4 for his Goodbye & Good Riddance effort. In the top 10, however, WRLD ON DRGUS is Future's 10th while being Juice's second.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ultimately, the duo couldn't pull up against the domineering A Star Is Born soundtrack for&nbsp;Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's film of the same name. Currently, the project is on its third week at No. 1 after earning 109,000 units this past week, with 61,000 going toward pure album sales. A Star Is Born is now the first movie soundtrack to spend its first three&nbsp;weeks at No. 1 in over 10 years. The last time the feat was accomplished was when Disney Channel's made-for-televison movie&nbsp;High School Musical 2's&nbsp;soundtrack reigned for it first four weeks. The last time a major motion picture released&nbsp;in theaters did the same was in 2003 when the Bad Boys II soundtrack stayed at No. 1 for its first four weeks as well.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Another notable&nbsp;debut on the chart comes from Khalid, whose Suncity arrives at No. 8 with 50,000 units and 9,000 from pure album sales. The seven-track&nbsp;EP marks the crooner's second top 10 outing as his American Teen debut album peaked at No. 4 last year.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In between, you'll find rock band Greta Van Fleet debuting at No. 3 with their debut studio&nbsp;album Anthem of the Peaceful Army&nbsp;earning 87,000 units with 80,000 being pure album sales. Following close behind is rock group Disturbed's Evolution album at No. 4 which pushes 71,000 units and 65,000 of pure album slaes, marking&nbsp;the first time in over three months that two rock albums sit in the top five of the Billboard 200.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At No. 5 is Lil Wayne's Carter V which goes down by 35 percent with 65,000 units while <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Baby</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Gunna</a>'s Drip Harder shifts 4-6 with 56,000 units. At No. 7, you'll find Drake's Scorpion with 51,000 units before landing on Khalid.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Closing things out after the singer are <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>'s AstroWorld&nbsp;at No.9 with 47,000 units and Post Malone's beerbongs & bentleys which continues its extended stay in the top 10 with 42,000 units.</p><p><br><h2>Billboard</h2></p><p>Future & Juice WRLD Debut At No. 2; Khalid Is No. 8 On Billboard 200</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhbH96fI9mna6spaeybq3NnWSjrZmYsm7D0aWbZpyVl8K1ecCtZKenXWd6rLTApaCdZZmoeq%2B7jHFkqKZdl7atuMGomKucXWd9cXnNnq6s</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anjelah-johnson-biography-net-worth-husband-nails-height-movies-and-tv-shows.html><span>←</span><span>Anjelah Johnson Biography; Net Worth, Husband, Nails, Height, Movies And TV Shows</span></a>
