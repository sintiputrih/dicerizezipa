She will be working alongside chief stew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fraser Olender</a>, master chef <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Hargrove</a>, and long-time Captain Lee Rosbach in the forthcoming season.</p><p>On 'Below Deck' Season 10, fans will meet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">three new stews</a> who are prepared to serve charter guests: Hayley, Alissa Hunter, and Camille Lamb, who will also serve as a deckhand. Season 9 second stew Fraser Olender will receive his first chance at the chief stew position. The Bravo 'Below Deck' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 10 teaser</a>, which debuted at BravoCon in October, features Hayley and her bright red hair throughout. According to her official 'Below Deck' cast profile on Bravo's website, Hayley doesn't seem to have much yachting experience, but at just 25, it's clear that she has a number of accolades to her name. Before the tenth season of 'Below Deck,' here are some things to know about Hayley.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>How much does it cost to charter ‚ÄòBelow Deck‚Äô yacht? Breaking down the cost of luxury cruisers</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Below Deck': Jessica Albert blames cameras for quitting mid-season, fans puzzled</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Hayley De Sola Pinto?</h2><p>Born on March 11, Hayley, who is from Cornwall, England, is essentially an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">advanced aesthetics practitioner</a> with a smaller charter resume than former 'Below Deck Med' star Kasey Cohen. Hayley founded Classen Aesthetics in 2020, offering procedures such as lip fillers, anti-wrinkle injections, and face contouring. According to her clinic's website, the advanced aesthetics practitioner takes pleasure in "having the unique ability to tailor treatments to each individual by both enhancing and complimenting their natural beauty." Although Hayley is always busy operating her own business, her 'Below Deck' cast profile adds that she joined the yachting profession two years ago and likes meeting new people while traveling. With sailing trips to Beverly Hills, New York, Vancouver, and Malta, to mention a few of the places she's been, it's evident that yachting and seeing the world is one of her hobbies!</p><p>In her 'Below Deck' introduction, Hayley stated that many would characterize her as a "sensational, stunning crazy mess, hot b**ch," and while she specialized in making guests feel welcome, her loud attitude frequently puts her in trouble. Hayley's Instagram reveals that she enjoys partying, traveling, and being out on the sea.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Modeling before sailing</h2><p>While numerous 'Below Deck' actors changed occupations after appearing on the show, others, such as Hayley, worked in other fields before opting to sail. Hayley's Instagram demonstrates that she dabbles in modeling and frequent poses for photographers trying to extend their portfolios, in addition to being a professional aesthetics practitioner. Hayley, like Magda Ziomek, a Polish model who was a stew on Season 1 of 'Below Deck Down Under,' appeared in New York Fashion Week in 2021.</p><p>She stated on social media that she is "forever grateful" for doing so and added:</p><p>"Just this weekend I was lucky enough to walk the runway at one of the biggest fashion events in the world , models designers and stylists came from all over the world to make this event what it was and I am forever grateful to be apart of it ü§©ü§ü we killed it, until next time ü•∞."</p><p>Her hair, which she stated was emblematic of her great goals, was styled in bouncy curls, and her outfit was designed by Nagwa's Boutique. Teofany Manus was the makeup artist behind her look.</p><h2 class=split>Secret beau</h2><p>While the 'Below Deck' series is recognized for providing viewers with an inside look at the charter boat business, its cast members are also notorious for hooking up after evenings out, especially because each season's crew lives and works in close quarters. Despite the fact that the 'Below Deck' Season 10 trailer teases passionate yachtmances and uncomfortable love triangles, Hayley is not seen to be embroiled in relationship turmoil, such as the tangled affair between parents Jean-Luc Cerza Lanaux and Dani Soares from Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 2. As per Hayley's Instagram, this is due to the fact that she has been in a relationship since at least 2020. Although Hayley's posts do not mention her boyfriend's name or any other details, he is very likely to be mentioned on 'Below Deck' Season 10.</p><p>Watch all-new episodes of 'Below Deck' Season 10 on Bravo starting Monday, November 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKGYsqSVrnqlsYyspqWZXaW2r8DOZqerp5aawLS1zqeYpWWRmsC1tMStoJyrXaW%2Foq%2FToquip56av267zZycZq%2BRobimsIynsJxloqq7uK3Y</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-jax-taylor-doing-now.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What is Jax Taylor doing now?</span></a>
