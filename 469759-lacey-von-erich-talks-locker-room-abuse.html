Call in (855) VOC-RADIO.</p><p>On Becoming a Wrestler:</p><p>If you never want to have a family or a wife or time to yourself, and you like being verbally and mentally abused, then you should [get into wrestling]. I say go for it. [That abuse comes more from] the locker room. Definitely the locker room. TNA is very different than WWE. WWE was very political. I wasn't in there yet. They were like, "You're a Von Erich. You better be amazing at wrestling," and things like that. And I wasn't. I'm more of an actress than I am a wrestler. I'd rather play a character than get hurt on the mat. That's what I'm better at. I'm better at acting. That's what I wanted to do. Vince called me. He's the one that got me into this. He's the one asked me, "Do you want to be a wrestler? Try to be a diva?" He brought me out and and I signed the contract that night and went into training. I wasn't expecting it to come as much. It really blew up and they expected so much of me. But then TNA called and they really embraced me as like a family member.</p><p>On Wrestlers Battling Demons:</p><p>It's so hard to leave [wrestling]. It’s really hard, once you leave, because no one ever understands what you went through ever. No one will know … People screaming your name or having fans and having those experiences together. Going from hotel to hotel, being on the road together. No one knows those experiences but [other wrestlers]. It really shapes the kind of person you can be. As you can see, in the past, [with] wrestlers, it can either shape you to be a great person and you can learn from it and become a great wife and mother, which I hope I have. Or you can end up self-medicating because of all that. You either get stronger or you get weaker. And luckily I came out of it, unlike the rest of my family, a stronger, better person.</p><p>On Her Earliest Memories of The Warrior:</p><p>My mom was just telling me that my dad actually trained [Warrior] … I was really young when my dad passed away. I was only 6 years old, but a lot of those memories have been grained in my mind because of the traumatic experience I went through. A lot of things when it comes to wrestling I don’t remember, because when we went to wrestling matches it would be 10, 11 o’clock at night and we would just be asleep in the stands … I remember more of Uncle Jimbo [Warrior] off of wrestling, not actually on the mat with everyone. I remember him at his house, and babysitting us, and things like that. It was like being babysat by my dad. Basically the same. A lot of roughhousing. A lot of fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgJVybm5xXaGupLHYZq2opl2av6qvx2armqSbqHqtu8KknKtloqS8rnnAm6ysnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diezel-ortiz-age.html><span>←</span><span>Diezel Ortiz (Instagram Star) Birthday, Parents, Wiki, Age, Siblings</span></a>
