She is currently<strong> 67 years old</strong> and she is originally from Hollywood, California. Her parents are her mother Dorothea Tzigkou and her father Hassan Halilov Ibrahimoff. Her mother was Greek and she grew up in Sotirë near Dropull I Sipërm in Albania. It is close to the border with Greece. Likewise, her father lived from 1920 to 2009. He was a Bulgarian Muslim (Pomak) born in Orazio (Breshtene), Greece. It is close to the border with Bulgaria.</p><p>Further, Rita’s father’s family moved to Bulgaria when he was a child. Then he later moved from Bulgaria to the US in 1949. Moreover, her father converted from Islam to Orthodox Christianity upon his marriage and also changed his name to Allan Wilson in 1960. He chose his name after a local street.</p><p>In addition to Bulgarian, Rita Wilson’s father could also speak Russian, Turkish, Polish, Greek, a little bit of Italian, and a little bit of French as per information provided by her husband, Tom Hanks. Hanks said that he modeled his portrayal of the character Viktor Navorski in the film The Terminal on his father-in-law.</p><p>Moreover, Rita Wilson has two siblings namely Lily Wilson and Chris Wilson. Lily is a teacher whereas Chris is the composer of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Rita and her niece, Carly Reeves, appear together on-screen in the movie Raise Your Voice starring Hilary Duff. Likewise, she also has another niece namely Kristen Reeves who is an entertainment reporter for Orange County TV.

Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Rita_Wilson_8211_Net_Worth_2024>Rita Wilson – Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>She has earned a hefty amount of money throughout her acting career. Likewise, Rita has a <strong>net worth</strong> estimation of approximately $100 million.</p><h2><span id=Experience_with_COVID-19>Experience with COVID-19</span></h2><p>After the news of Rita and Tom Hanks’ COVID-19 positive news, Trevor Noah said on The Daily Show, “It’s almost like coronavirus chose Tom Hanks just to send a message to the rest of us. Like prison rules: ‘If I can get Hanks, I can get to anyone.’” The American power couple tested positive for the global pandemic of COVID-19 when they were in Australia.</p><p>Both Rita and her husband Tom Hanks first developed symptoms on 9 March 2020. They hence tested the following day. Doctors told them that they were probably exposed to the virus by the same person at the same time. However, no one they knew had tested positive back then. It’s still a mystery as to how the couple caught it at the same time.</p><p>When they tested positive, they were still in Australia for the preproduction of Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley film. In this movie, Tom Hanks plays Presley’s manager Colonel Tom Parker. After they tested positive, Tom and Rita were isolated in a Queensland hospital while their symptoms were monitored. They were quarantined in the hospital so as not to spread the virus, more precisely, at the Gold Coast University Hospital.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41269 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rita-Wilson-testing-for-antibodies-for-COVID-19-research-at-UCLA.jpg alt="Rita Wilson" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41269 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Rita testing for antibodies for COVID-19 research at UCLA. Source: Instagram</p><h4><span>Symptoms</span></h4><p>Rita, in particular, had tried to be hyper-vigilant. She shared about her precautions even before the disease was this serious.</p><p>“It was early March, and so people weren’t social distancing yet. But I was already doing no handshakes, no hugging, trying to take my own measures. Then on the plane to Australia, I was like Lady Macbeth – I couldn’t clean everything enough! The flight attendants were like: ‘What is with this lady?’ I had wipes, sanitizer, I wiped down everything.”</p><p>Both Hanks and Wilson’s symptoms were severe enough and hence were hospitalized together. Particularly, Wilson’s temperature reached 102 degrees Fahrenheit and doctors gave her chloroquine to try to bring her fever down. Rita Wilson stresses that she was not given “hydroxychloroquine” referring to the unproven treatment President Trump has been promoting back then. Although her fever came down, she experienced the incredibly harsh side effects of the drug.</p><p>“We both had a high fever and were extremely achy. I lost my sense of taste and smell, had stomach issues, and was shivering like you wouldn’t believe. Yeah, I was scared. Extreme nausea, vertigo, my muscles felt like wet noodles, so I couldn’t really stand.</p><p>The couple was unaware of the international reaction to their announcement because they hardly watched TV and stayed almost entirely offline. It was except to be in contact with close friends and family. Further, Rita told Gayle King on CBS This Morning that she was very tired and experienced chills like never before. She said that she felt extremely achy and uncomfortable and didn’t want to be touched, and then the fever started.</p><h4><span>Plasma Donation for Research and Vaccine Development</span></h4><p>Even though the coronavirus impacted the lovers differently, it took both the same time to get through the disease as Rita said. Moreover, they donated blood and are waiting to hear back if their antibodies will help develop a vaccine.</p><p>Rita and Tom would also donate plasma if they can. They are now fully recovered from the coronavirus and are back home in Los Angeles, where they are staying inside and watching a lot of old movies. Moreover, they were photographed smiling while driving a vehicle in Los Angeles. Celebrity website TMZ added that those photographs were taken shortly after they landed at a small Los Angeles area airport.</p><p>The New York Post’s Page Six column then went on to add that Tom Hanks was touching the tarmac and dancing after getting off a private jet. Filming has long been shut down in the movie and hundreds of other film and television productions worldwide.</p><p>On 24 April, Tom Hanks shared a Facebook post urging his followers to donate if they were in LA. Then on 28 April 2020, he shared another Facebook post with photos of him donating blood plasma for research purposes. Similarly, Rita also shared an Instagram post on 29 April 2020 in which she is getting tested for antibodies in preparation for donating plasma. She also thanked Dr. Anne Rimoin at UCLA for the study she is working on to help patients heal from COVID-19.</p><p>Following the news of Tom Hanks and Rita, plenty of famous people have been diagnosed with positive cases of the pandemic including Idris Elba and Placido Domingo.</p><h4><span>Other Health Issues</span></h4><p>In April 2015, Rita shared that she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery.
