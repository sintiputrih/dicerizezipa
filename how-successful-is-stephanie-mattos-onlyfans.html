"I am not full of s**t or trying to sell you a lie," she said via a since-deleted <a href=#>Instagram Story</a>, "The proof is there, I have the tips and tricks on how to make a living doing this, and it may not be easy, but it's possible!" And just how much proof was there? Roughly $40,000 worth.</p><p>Between Aug. 1 and Aug. 14, 2020, Stephanie apparently brought home about $10,000 in subscriptions, $1,000 in tips, and $23,000 worth of messaging fees from her OnlyFans. She's been able to buy a house and some cars with her earnings, but some of that money also goes right back into the business.</p><p>On Sept. 3, 2020, Stephanie posted a video to her YouTube channel entitled "<a href=#>WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FACE!??</a>" where she opened up about <a href=#>getting plastic surgery</a>. She opted for liposuction to remove a small pouch of fat under her chin. "I would see [the fat] if I ever had a side profile photo of myself, I would see it on television," she said. "As you guys know, my job is literally my appearance... because I do OnlyFans. So, I want to feel my best and this was something that bothered me for a long time throughout the years." According to <a href=#>Real Self</a>, the procedure costs around $3,000. You gotta spend money to make money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21gbH93e8eormarpZiwpr%2FSn6ylZZmoerTAxKmfmqaZmnqurdOtpqxln6O5urLAp6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fantasia-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Fantasia Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</span></a>
