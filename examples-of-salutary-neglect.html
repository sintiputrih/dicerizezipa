The money from the taxes went to England, not the colonies from where they originated. The <b>policy of Salutary Neglect</b> allowed the colonial merchants to flout, or violate, the Navigation Acts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-salutary-neglect-simple></span>What is salutary neglect simple?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Salutary neglect</b>, policy of the British government from the early to mid-18th century regarding its North American colonies under which trade regulations for the colonies were laxly enforced and imperial supervision of internal colonial affairs was loose as long as the colonies remained loyal to the British government<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-use-salutary-neglect-in-a-sentence></span>How do you use salutary neglect in a sentence?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>salutary neglect</b> of the past half century, in the British government’s view, could have no place in the new imperial system. The end of this period of <b>salutary neglect</b> marked the beginning of a new era of British innovations in colonial policy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-salutary-neglect-and-why-is-it-important></span>What is salutary neglect and why is it important?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Salutary neglect</b> was an unofficial British policy of non-enforcement of trade regulations on their American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries. The purpose was to maximize economic output amongst the colonists while maintain some form of control.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-salutary-neglect-affect-the-colonies></span>How did salutary neglect affect the colonies?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Indeed, <b>salutary neglect</b> enabled the American <b>colonies</b> to prosper by trading with non-British entities, and then to spend that wealth on British-made goods, while at the same time providing Britain with raw materials for manufacture.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-did-salutary-neglect-begin></span>When did salutary neglect begin?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>From the early 18th century to 1763, <b>salutary neglect</b> was employed. After 1763, Britain <b>began</b> to try to enforce stricter rules and more direct management, leading eventually to the American Revolutionary War.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-did-the-end-of-salutary-neglect-lead-to></span>What did the end of salutary neglect lead to?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>end of salutary neglect</b> was what <b>led to</b> the growing tension between the colonies and Great Britain, which eventually <b>led to</b> the American Revolutionary War.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-the-colonies-practiced-self-government-during-salutary-neglect></span>How did the colonies practiced self government during salutary neglect?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Salutary neglect</b> was a large contributing factor that led to the American Revolutionary War. Since the imperial authority <b>did</b> not assert the power that it had, the <b>colonists were</b> left to govern themselves. These essentially sovereign <b>colonies</b> soon became accustomed to the idea of <b>self</b>-control.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-england-end-salutary-neglect></span>Why did England end salutary neglect?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>salutary neglect</b> period ended as a consequence of the French and Indian War, also known as the Seven Years War, from years 1755 to 1763. This caused a large war debt that <b>the British</b> needed to pay off, and thus the policy was destroyed in the colonies.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-britains-policy-of-salutary-neglect-affect></span>How did Britain’s policy of salutary neglect affect?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>How did Britain’s policy of salutary neglect affect</b> the American colonies? It led to greater restrictions on colonial self-government. It led to an increased sense of independence from <b>Britain</b>. It led to political chaos, weakening the sense of an American identity.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-the-policy-of-salutary-neglect-benefit-england></span>How did the policy of salutary neglect benefit England?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>policy of salutary neglect benefited</b> the colonies because it allowed them to conduct business without extreme oversight by the English. The <b>policy benefited</b> the English because of the economic <b>benefits</b> and profit brought in by the colonists’ trade and industry.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-did-salutary-neglect-end></span>When did salutary neglect end?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>End</b> of <b>Salutary Neglect</b>:<p>The era of <b>salutary neglect</b> officially come to an <b>end</b> in the 1760s. In February of 1763, the Seven Year’s War came to an <b>end</b>. Around the same time, in April of 1763, the new Prime Minister, George Grenville, came into office. Both of these events contributed to the <b>end</b> of <b>salutary neglect</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-britains-salutary-neglect-of-the-colonies-gradually-lead-to-independence></span>How did Britain’s salutary neglect of the colonies gradually lead to independence?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>How did Britain’s</b> “<b>salutary neglect” of the colonies gradually lead</b> to their de facto <b>independence</b>? The policy made it so the <b>colonies</b> were tied to <b>Britain</b> in terms of trade and the way they were governed. England’s failure to enforce the laws in the <b>colonies</b> left people there with a feeling of more <b>independence</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-the-end-of-salutary-neglect-increase-tensions></span>How did the end of salutary neglect increase tensions?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Colonists resented the <b>end</b> of “<b>salutary neglect</b>,” the curtailment of self-government, and inability to set taxation policy (“no taxation without representation”).

The smugglers would pay bribes to <b>British</b> customs officials who were hired to regulate trade in the <b>colonies</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-england-allow-the-colonies-to-self-govern></span>How did England allow the colonies to self govern?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The idea of <b>self</b>–<b>government</b> was encouraged by the Glorious Revolution and the 1689 Bill of Rights which established that the British Parliament—and not the king—had the ultimate authority in <b>government</b>. In the 1730s, the Parliament began to pass laws regulating their <b>colonies</b> in the Americas.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-was-salutary-neglect-quizlet></span>What was salutary neglect quizlet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Salutary Neglect</b>. a period from 1607-1763 in which England did not strictly enforce Parliamentary laws, which allowed the colonies to flourish as almost independent states for many years.
