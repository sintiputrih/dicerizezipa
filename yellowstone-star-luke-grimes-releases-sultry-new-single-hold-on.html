With longing in his voice, Grimes narrates a tale in “Hold On,” and it sets the tone for the highs and lows fans will experience when we listen to the entire track-list in full.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>Grimes announced his new accolade – country singer – back in September of 2022, and he’s already gifted fans with “No Horse to Ride” and “Oh Ohio.” With “Hold On” joining the ranks, he’s sharing a passion and vulnerability on a different plane with each tune. From romance to longing and a fear of getting too close — Grimes is crafting a side hustle for fans of all ages and circumstances to enjoy, one we’ll never want to stop listening to.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>In “Hold On,” Grimes tells the story of someone who keeps their walls up high enough to discourage anyone from getting in; the lyrics showcase someone who’s been burned and takes every precaution to prevent it from happening again.</p><p>“Hold me, but I don’t recommend that you adore me. If you do, don’t say I didn’t warn you. Trust me, I know how to start a fire from a female. Oh, I always leave before the curtain hits the floorboard, when I hear you talking like you know me — you don’t know me.”</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>In addition to the release of his new single, Grimes shared the album art for the single, which fits the tune’s mood perfectly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luke Grimes (@lukegrimes)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Country Now</a> shared the following statement from Grimes, and noted that it’s one of only two songs on his forthcoming album that he didn’t write himself.</p><p>‘”Hold On’ has become one of my favorite songs on the (upcoming) album. Foy Vance is one of my favorite current songwriters, and although he and I couldn’t get together in person, I knew I wanted him to be a part of this album. He had this song that had not been cut, and I immediately fell in love with the words; I felt so connected to it. It’s a familiar feeling, the fear of falling too deeply for someone because you could ultimately get hurt. I think it’s a universal feeling for anyone who has had their heart broken.”</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>If you’ve managed to live this long without feeling heartache, well — we’d love to chat with you about how, but if you’re anything like us, this song will resonate with you; and that’s Grimes’ hope. He’s crafting music that feels like an experience; he’s a storyteller, and we’re hanging on his every word.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y6sculprCrpKS7pnnSrZirZZyquKZ5xqugpp2jYr%2BmuMSaqp6rXajCrcDRsmSnnadiwKq6xqWcZqCfobFuu81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-ashley-reeves-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Ashley Reeves Husband?</span></a>
