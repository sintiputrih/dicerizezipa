The women in question, during the time when Tate was accused of human trafficking and rape, were reportedly who walked around with this branding. He has even been recorded making similar claims in conversations with publications like Barstool Sports. During that time, he was quoted saying, "It's not about being property, it's about she belongs to him," and "because they're in a relationship." The same does not, in Tate's opinion, apply to male equivalents since, in his opinion, "the woman belongs(s) to the man" and has "a stake in those pasts," but not the reverse.</p><h2 class=split>Tate's chest Tattoo</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Andrew Tate's 37th birthday bash clip creates buzz across Internet, trolls say 'this is haram'</a></p><p>At first glance, the tattoo inked on Tate's chest appears to be a mix of an Oni mask and a snake-like design. There is more to it than what actually seems even though the execution might not be the best. Tate claims that the tattoo is an image of the devil's face and a snake, signifying his ongoing struggle with the devil. He believes that God sent him to Earth, and this tattoo symbolizes ongoing conflict with evil.</p><p>It's interesting to note that Andrew's tattoo on his chest wasn't his first. He had a butterfly tattooed on his arm before the devil and snake. He didn't like how it turned out, though, and thought it didn't accurately reflect him. He didn't believe the butterfly fit him because he considered himself a "Cobra Tate." However, even this ink was a coverup for a previous tattoo Andrew had on his chest.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Andrew Tate shares philosophical take on 'bad luck' ruining people's lives, Internet says 'our actions and attitudes impact us'</a></p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Andrew Tate's views fueling misogyny in schoolchildren as young as 9, report finds</a></p><p><a href=#>Andrew Tate willing to go to 'jail' for brother Tristan Tate, Internet says 'family always first'</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5iueqW1w2aYp5yimsRuwMCtnGaZnKGyqLHDpbBmrJGpwbC7jJ6tnqqpYsSwucCnZKGdXaTEr7HDZqCnZaKkuqK6yJpknrCgobyztc2gZKadkaO2r7OMm5yhoZ6Zeqm10maaoZ2jqXqquso%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-carlie-craig-keith-leak-jr-baby-momma-and-girlfriend-2022-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Carlie Craig?
